        "articleBody": "Opinion | Republicans Are Following Trump to Nowhere - The New York Times\n\nSections\nSEARCH\nSkip to content Skip to site index\nLog In\nLog In\nToday’s Paper\nOpinion | Republicans Are Following Trump to Nowhere\nSubscribe\nLog In\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\nOpinion\n\nSupported by\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans Are Following Trump to Nowhere\n\nThere’s an impeachment lesson hiding in the president’s failure to produce the political results he wants.\n\nBy Jamelle Bouie\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nTrump asked voters in Louisiana for a big win. He didn’t get it. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAmericans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major, statewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governor’s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\n“Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!” Trump tweeted before Election Day. “Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!”\n\nTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. “Virginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,” he said.\n\n“The people of this country aren’t buying” impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. “You see it because we’re going up and they’re going down.”\n\n“You gotta give me a big win please,” he said later. “Please.”\n\nTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points. Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory — their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.\n\nIt’s true that Democrats didn’t run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear — whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state — promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.\n\nBut just because no one ran on impeachment doesn’t mean it wasn’t in the air. Voters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They could have elevated the president’s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an unambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president’s immediate political fortunes.\n\nTo start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that “President Trump’s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.” And an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans say that the inciting offense — Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival — was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he “committed impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.”\n\nWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication — proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the president’s wrongdoing.\n\nBut it’s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table — that there’s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president’s phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldn’t be fishing expeditions — given the president’s refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, there’s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas — but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldn’t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)\n\nI don’t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnell’s hands until there’s a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, there’s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of what’s been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Auto Show\n1 / 23\nBack to Gallery\n\nNew electric vehicles, several new small SUVs, a redesigned compact car, a plug-in version of Toyota’s top-selling vehicle and a futuristic electric station wagon concept car from Volkswagen are among the new models on display this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\nToyota is displaying a rechargeable hybrid version of the RAV4 — the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that’s not a pickup truck — while Ford is rolling out an all-new electric SUV that carries the Mustang performance car brand name. There also is a redesigned compact Sentra from Nissan.\n\nThe show opens to the public on Friday. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nNISSAN SENTRA\n\nNissan is hoping a sleek redesign of the Sentra compact sedan will pull in more buyers in a struggling segment of the U.S. market.\n\nThe 2020 Sentra, which goes on sale in late January, loses the old version’s upright econobox look. It’s built on new underpinnings that lower it two inches and make it two inches wider than the outgoing model. It’s got a coupe look that mimics the design of newer Nissan models like the Altima and Maxima. The new version gets a new 149 horsepower, 2-liter four-cylinder engine that’s 20% more powerful than the current model, yet Nissan says it will offer better gas mileage. It also gets a new rear suspension and steering system to improve handling. Even though it’s an entry-level car, it comes standard with six safety systems including automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Price and gas mileage were not announced.\n\nVOLKSWAGEN ID. SPACE VIZZION CONCEPT\n\nVolkswagen is giving us a glimpse into the car of the future with a low-slung electric station wagon called the ID. Space Vizzion Concept.\n\nThe German automaker, which has focused on electric vehicles after its diesel emissions-cheating scandal, says the wagon will be able to go 300 miles on a single battery charge. It has a rear-mounted 275-horsepower motor, but a second motor could be installed for all-wheel-drive, giving the car 355 horsepower. The all-wheel-drive version will be able to go from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in five seconds, Volkswagen says. To limit wind drag, the car has touch surfaces on the doors in place of conventional door handles. An augmented reality 15.6-inch touch screen that appears to float in the air has all entertainment, climate control and online information. VW says the car is a preview of a production vehicle for North America and Europe, but it didn’t say when the wagon will go on sale.\n\nFORD MUSTANG MACH E\n\nFord will display its first all-electric SUV, marking the start of an avalanche of battery-powered vehicles coming from mainstream and luxury automakers during the next two years that industry analysts say will boost electric vehicle sales.\n\nAnalysts expect the number of electric vehicles for sale in the U.S. to grow from 16 currently to as many as 80 by 2022. They say the increased selection and longer range of the new vehicles will make them more popular.\n\nFord’s Mustang Mach E SUV will go 230 miles to more 300 miles per charge depending on how it’s equipped. It will start at $44,000, not including a $7,500 federal tax credit.\n\nThe car gets some Mustang styling cues including triple taillights, a fastback rear and a long hood. A performance GT version will be able to go from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in about 3.5 seconds.\n\nThe Mach E was unveiled Sunday night ahead of the Los Angeles show.\n\nTOYOTA RAV4 PRIME\n\nToyota is rolling out a plug-in electric version of the popular RAV4 small SUV that’s more efficient and faster than the current versions.\n\nThe 2021 RAV4 Prime will be able to go 39 miles (63 kilometers) on battery power alone before the gas-electric hybrid propulsion system kicks in. It will get the equivalent of 90 miles per gallon (38 kilometers per liter) of gasoline, according to Toyota. Yet the 302-horsepower system will take the car from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in 5.8 seconds — a full two seconds faster than the current RAV4 Hybrid. The SUV, which is the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. that isn’t a pickup truck, has a tuned-up version of the RAV4 Hybrid’s 176 hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine powering the front wheels. A separate rear-mounted electric motor powers the rear wheels when needed. Toyota says the battery is mounted under the floor, giving the SUV a lower center of gravity and improving its handling. The RAV4 Prime goes on sale in the summer. The price wasn’t announced.\n\nMost Popular\n\n1\n\nLongtime CT gunmaker leaving state for Wyoming\n\n2\n\nShelton teacher realizes dream on Wheel of Fortune\n\n3\n\nPolice call disappearance of bar owner ‘suspicious’\n\n4\n\nFairfield dumping documents unsealed\n\n5\n\n3 busted after CT raid finds fentanyl-laced heroin\n\n6\n\nBrickyard Pub owner charged with selling cocaine at Fairfield restaurant\n\n7\n\nPolice: Gift card scam costs Derby woman nearly $10K\n\nConnecticut Post\n\nView Comments\n© 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc.\nLogo Return to Top\n\nAbout\n\nPrivacy Notice\nInterest Based Ads\nYour California Privacy Rights\nTerms of Use\nCareers\nAdvertising\nArchives\n\nContact\n\nContact Us\nFAQ\nToday's eEdition\nSubmissions\n\nConnect\n\nNewsletter Sign-Up\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\nHearst Newspapers © Copyright Hearst Media Services Connecticut, LLC"

He also agreed to return the cash he received from the use of “We.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\n\nWeWork agreed to a rescue by its largest shareholder, Japanese technology investment company SoftBank Group Corp, last month as it faced a cash crunch. SoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to fund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for some of Neumann’s shares.\n\nWeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later this week in areas that do not support WeWork’s core business goals, said The We Company’s recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to staff that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000 jobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others who work for affiliates.\n\nNext steps to shape the company’s future will be divulged in an all-company meeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\n\nHe said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization to grow. “We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities,” added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\n\nAn October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would be cut, along with jobs in WeWork’s venture capital arm and in so-called growth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction units.\n\nThis is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG.

SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message - SlashGear\n\nEXPLORE\nTech\nCars\nGaming\nEntertainment\nScience\nFEATURES\nReviews\nColumns\n\nTech\nCars\nGaming\nEntertainment\nScience\nFeatures\n\nReviews\nColumns\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\nRSS\nSearch SlashGear\nSearch\n\nThe VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message\n\nChris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 10:31 pm CST\n0\n\nVolkswagen’s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn’t expected until next year, but the automaker isn ‘t slowing down on stacking up new potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the modular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the most striking yet.\n\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a well-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID. SPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it’s weighing a potential production version for North America and Europe.\n\nThe MEB’s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker with the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show this week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is – at 195-inches – about as long as a VW Atlas Cross Sport SUV. However it’s narrower and lower.\n\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it’s enough to give the ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There’s electronic damping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\n\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to the front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph could arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited 109 mph.\n\nAs for range, in RWD form you’re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP cycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on the EPA cycle.\n\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW’s engineers used some clever airflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being guided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of the car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\n\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing wind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up; touch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical lighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined by an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\n\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing them flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption. The roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear. That’s also where you’ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip crossing the white VW logo.\n\nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the ID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes headlamps that look like they’re eyes opening.\n\nInside, there’s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench instead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there’s AppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice production. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done away with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker says it’ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of the material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\n\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the driver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment, and other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can be assigned to different touch-surface controls. There’s a large, fold-out center console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW’s 20.7 cubic foot trunk has two electric longboards underneath.\n\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch panels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery mode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation and other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively change to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural language voice control is supported, too.\n\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a luxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes to put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market sometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the ability of that to support more niche models in a way that’s still cost effective.\n\nStory Timeline\n\n2020 VW ID.3 official as Volkswagen bets on electric\nAs VW ID.3 production begins, Volkswagen bets it all on an electric future\n\nVW ID.

(Photo Credit : PTI File Photo )\n\nIn case you are living in Delhi-NCR, chances are you have an app or two to find out the latest air quality index in your area. Since Diwali, despite the Supreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the monitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become a standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower surface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the National Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social media about an ‘oxygen bar’!\n\nYup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to Condé Nast Traveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about this unique ‘bar’. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone who is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we have an oxygen bar in Delhi?\n\nThe answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and landed up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhi’s Saket area that offers this unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is ‘Oxy Pure’. “An Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched with an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air pollutants in a cost-effective manner,” the description on the website reads.\n\nOffering ‘rejuvenating’ experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, “consists of an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating customers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula along with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you with more vigour and energy.”\n\nThe brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and Margarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas and decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299 for fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\n\nSo now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to visit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right now is 218, which is in ‘poor’ category.\n\nFirst Published: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 08:38 AM\n\nRelated Tags:\n\nDelhi Pollution\nDelhi Smog\nOxygen\nSaket\nAir Quality\n\n0 Post Comment (+)\nLIVE TV VIdeos Photos\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nHappy Birthday Rajkumar Hirani: 5 Movies Of The Director That You Can Watch On Loop\n\nInternational Men’s Day: Most Handsome Classic Actors That Even Put John Legend To Shame\n\nHappy Birthday Sushmita Sen: These Pictures Of Former Miss Universe With Rohman Shawl Are Just Unmissable!\n\nFarhan Akhtar's Girlfriend Shibani Dandekar Sets Internet On Fire With Super-Sexy Pictures\n\nTerms of Use\nCareer\nAdvertise With Us\nComplaint Redressal\nContact Us\nFeedback\nSitemap\nRSS\n\n© 2019 News Nation.

Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\n\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\n\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds.\n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end.\n\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again.\n\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"\n\nPick Six Newsletter\n\nGet the day's big stories + fun stuff you love like mock drafts, picks and power rankings.\n\nI agree that CBS Sports can send me the \"Pick Six Newsletter\" newsletter.\n\nSee All Newsletters\nPlease check the opt-in box to acknowledge that you would like to subscribe.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nKeep an eye on your inbox for the latest sports news.\n\nSorry!\n\nThere was an error processing your subscription.\n\n2019 NFL Playoff Picture\n\nNFL Scores | Expert Picks | Odds\n2019 NFL playoff picture | Standings\n\nJoin our Free $1,000,000 Parlay Challenge\n\nPlay Now\nOur Latest Stories\n\nGronk, Serena perform with Laker Girls\n\nGronk may have found his true calling\n\nNFL odds, cheat sheet, picks, bets, sims\n\nSportsLine's computer model simulated every Week 12 NFL game 10,000 times with surprising results.\n\nJones tells Belichick story from '90s\n\nThe Cowboys owner actually might've had a chance to hire Belichick before he went to New England\n\nNFL office pool picks for Week 12\n\nSportsLine's advanced computer just locked in its Week 12 NFL office pool picks.\n\nPats place Olszewski on IR\n\nNew England's roster is re-shuffling\n\nPlayoff picture: Raiders in pursuit\n\nBreaking down the 2019 NFL playoff picture after Sunday's Week 11 action\n\nChiefs vs. Chargers: Recap, highlights\n\nKansas City has held on to their lead in the AFC West\n\nRams top Bears as offenses struggle\n\nNeither the Rams nor Bears could get much going offensively on Sunday night\n\nHelp\nAbout Us\nCareers\nAdvertise\nSite Map\nNewsletters\nMobile Apps\nCollege Network\nAd Choice\nClosed Captioning\nPrivacy\nTerms\nMobile User Agreement\n\nSportsLine.com\n\n© 2004-2019 CBS Interactive.

Disney’s $6.99-a-month service is stocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, “Star Wars,” Marvel Studios and classic Disney fare, including “Mary Poppins” and “Bambi.”\n\nThere were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had forgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day reported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others reported being abruptly logged off the service.\n\n“We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn’t make me feel good,” Mayer, Disney’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international, said Tuesday at the Vox Media’s Code Media conference in Hollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney’s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and “patched” the software as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout the week.\n\nKevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming service\n(Walt Disney Co.)\n\nAn undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial, although it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer hinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\n“We’ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see ” Mayer said.\n\nThe streaming service represents a shift in Disney’s business strategy and, potentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered its business. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney’s flagship ESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services, such as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3 billion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take on Netflix at its own game.\n\nNetflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the so-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\n“We will see the industry shake out a bit,” Mayer said. “Not everyone will succeed.”\n\nWall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best positioned for success, and how many streaming services consumers will sign up for. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he thinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether subscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\n\nHe declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to stream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+ app. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast networks and the cable channel ESPN.\n\nEventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its sports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that would probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\n“There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,” Mayer said. “We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.”\n\nGetting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer’s mettle. He is viewed as a potential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the design and last week’s rollout of the service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayer was named chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international division in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and corporate strategy executive at the company.\n\nHe led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and BamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological backbone of Disney’s streaming efforts.\n\nIt’s the first time in Mayer’s career with Disney that he has been in a hands-on operational role.\n\n“Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,” Mayer said. “ I love what I’m doing.”\n\nCompany Town Television Business Entertainment & Arts\nNewsletter\nGet our daily Entertainment newsletter\nSubscribe\nMeg James\nFollow Us\n\ntwitter\ninstagram\nemail\nfacebook\n\nMeg James is a corporate media reporter for the Los Angeles Times, covering the business of television and digital disruption in the entertainment industry.

(Manu Fernandez/AP)\n\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\nMADRID — Rafael Nadal kept Spain’s hopes alive, then Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez completed the comeback in the decisive doubles match to give the hosts a 2-1 win over Russia in the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.\n\nGranollers and Lopez defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-4, 7-6 (5) to seal the victory for Spain in a marathon series that ended close to 2 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nThe top-ranked Nadal earlier defeated Khachanov 6-3, 7-6 (7) to level the series 1-1 after Rublev had rallied to beat Roberto Bautista-Agut 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (0) in the first match.\n\n\"It was a difficult situation for us,\" Lopez said. \"We needed this win, otherwise we could be close to being out of the tournament. Now we are in a good position to advance.\"\n\nAlthough only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight hours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court. Spain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia. Russia beat Croatia on Monday.\n\nIn the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two singles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six groups.\n\n\"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a position that you don’t want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match, we were under pressure.\"\n\nSerbia’s Novak Djokovic and Britain’s Andy Murray will make their first appearance on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays the Netherlands.\n\nThe Davis Cup Finals is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams playing in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year partnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group co-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique.\n\nBrazil star Neymar was among the more than 12,000 in attendance, which also included a marching band organized by Spanish fans that fired up the crowd throughout the matches.\n\nUS FALLS\n\nThe United States lost to Canada for the first time in the Davis Cup after Vasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov defeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\n\"Came down to a few points,\" Opelka said. \"Thought I did my part, played well, served well, and I put myself in a position to win. He was just too good.\"\n\nThe U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American neighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\n\nFRANCE WINS\n\nTwo days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\n\nHerbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-ranked France a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but capitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year’s Davis Cup runner-up.\n\nThe teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1 and Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\n\nHerbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals, where they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand in the final on Sunday.\n\n\"We know we’ve arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of confidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win but we’re really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\n\nARGENTINA CRUISES\n\nArgentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2, 6-2.\n\nThe tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped Jarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\n\"It’s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for sure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I think Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played unreal tennis.\"\n\nKAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\n\nKazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and clinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\n\nThe Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van de Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\n\"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\n\nAUSTRALIA AHEAD\n\nAustralia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios’ 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and Alex de Minaur’s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\n\nColombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\n\nMore from Sportsnet\nEpic singles wins give Canada best Davis Cup Finals start imaginable\nRyan McKenna\nShapovalov, Pospisil give Canada a pair of upsets over Italy at Davis Cup\nCanadian Press\n\n%2Ftennis%2Fargentina-comfortably-wins-davis-cup-opener-chile%2F\nJoin the Conversation\nWhen submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

All opinions are mine alone. #HealthyHydration #ad\n\nWhen you live in a state as beautiful as Colorado it’s impossible to stay inside. We moved here two years ago and we’re still in awe of the beauty and take advantage of it every chance we can get. When you think of Colorado you probably think of the mountains, but one thing that most people don’t realize is that it’s quite arid. Whether you’re out exploring or just hanging around the house, water is a must here.\n\nOur hiking survival kit is really very simple.\n\nArrowhead bottled water\nbaby carrier\nhealthy snack bars\ncamera\n\nIn the time we’ve lived here and all of the times we’ve been to Boulder, one place we hadn’t yet visited were the Boulder Flatirons. We always have a baby carrier in the car so for our hike we just had to make a pit stop at Walmart for some easy to carry bottled Arrowhead water and healthy snack bars.\n\nRed was our water boy for this trip. Armed with some ice packs and a portable cooler bag, the Arrowhead water stayed nice and cold while being easy for a teenager to carry on a mountain hike. We use Arrowhead bottled water because their bottles are made from BPA-free PET plastic.\n\nReally, have you ever seen anything so gorgeous?\n\nThis guy learned the importance of staying hydrated very early on. Soon after we moved here we went to a festival and he didn’t take our warnings to keep hydrated seriously and passed out while waiting in line for a ride. Since that day he has never forgotten to make sure he has water at all times when outside, especially in the warmer months.\n\nEven Dub had his Arrowhead water in a cup while getting a piggyback ride from daddy. Our baby carrier is another must-have here. Even though he isn’t a baby anymore he still loves to ride in his carrier. This allows us to do more hiking than we normally would since we don’t have to worry about him being able to keep up or getting tired.\n\nWhile we’re at home we still have to stay hydrated and would love to one day purchase a water cooler for the BPA-free 5-gallon bottles of Arrowhead water. Hopefully, Walmart will have these available soon so we don’t have to make sure we’re home for a delivery. That would be a huge time saver for us.\n\nBe sure to visit Arrowhead on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nWhat is your favorite weekend family activity?

(NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/David Ladd)\nSPACE\n\nNASA Just Confirmed There Are Water Plumes Above The Surface of Jupiter's Moon Europa\n\nVICTOR TANGERMANN, FUTURISM\n18 NOV 2019\n\nA team led by researchers out of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has confirmed traces of water vapor above the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa.\n\nAnd that's a big deal as the tiny space rock is one of the highest priority targets in NASA's search for extraterrestrial life, according to the agency.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" lead researcher and NASA planetary scientist Lucas Paganini said in a NASA statement.\n\nAccording to a paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy on Monday, the NASA team discovered enough water vapor being released from Europa to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.\n\nBut while that sounds like a lot, it was only just enough to be detected from Earth.\n\nOut of 17 observations by the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which uses a spectrograph to detect the chemical compositions of other planets' atmospheres by scanning the infrared light they release or absorb, the scientists only spotted water vapor in one.\n\n\"We suggest that the outgassing of water vapour on Europa occurs at lower levels than previously estimated, with only rare localized events of stronger activity,\" Paganini and his team wrote in the paper.\n\nFor many years, scientists have suspected that there's water on Europa's surface, and several observations appear to back up that suspicion.\n\nMore than two decades ago, NASA's Galileo spacecraft found evidence of an electrically conductive fluid on the moon's surface. Then, a 2018 analysis of the data found evidence of massive plumes of liquid. Data previously collected by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope supported the existence of the plumes.\n\n\"We performed diligent safety checks to remove possible contaminants in ground-based observations,\" Goddard planetary scientist Avi Mandell said of the water vapor discovery in the statement. \"But, eventually, we'll have to get closer to Europa to see what's really going on.\"\n\nA mission to do just that is already lined up.\n\nNASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission will get a much closer look at the icy moon's surface as soon as 2023.\n\nThe spacecraft will feature a suite of cameras, spectrometers, and a radar to investigate the thickness of Europa's icy shell during 45 flybys — and perhaps yield further insights into the water vapor above the moon's surface while it's there.\n\nThis article was originally published by Futurism.

Kristi Noem Kristi Lynn Noem South Dakota governor doubles down on 'meth, we're on it' anti-drug campaign South Dakota drops pipeline protest laws after lawsuit New South Dakota law requiring 'In God We Trust' sign to hang in public schools goes into effect MORE (R) is defending the state’s launch of an anti-drug campaign with the slogan “Meth, we’re on it.”\n\nThe tagline drew a mix of criticism and ridicule across Twitter on Monday, but Noem cited the backlash as proof that efforts to raise awareness around South Dakota's methamphetamine crisis was, in fact, working.\n\n“Meth is IN SD. Twitter can make a joke of it, but when it comes down to it - Meth is a serious problem in SD. We are here to Get. It. OUT,” Noem tweeted Monday night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNoem later tweeted that the state’s meth epidemic “needs to be a dinner table conversation,” adding “we need everyone on it.”\n\nThe campaign, which includes both digital and TV ads, cost the state roughly $449,000, according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.\n\nOne campaign video featured a series of South Dakotans — including both adults and children — declaring, “I’m on meth.” The video, as well as photos of people with the tagline, prompted some Twitter users to argue that the promotional material made it look as if those featured in the campaign were on the drug themselves.\n\n“South Dakota: if we were any higher, we’d be North Dakota,” one user quipped.\n\nAnother wondered why the state bothered to trademark the tagline in the first place.\n\nI love that they trademarked it. Don't worry, South Dakota, no one's going to take your slogan. https://t.co/XPxUJuyIAC\n\n— Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) November 18, 2019\n\nThe latest initiative comes as the state struggles to address its growing rate of methamphetamine use in recent years, particularly among its youth.\n\nIn 2016, the South Dakota's Department of Social Services reported that the number of young people in the state who have reported using meth was 3.8 percent, compared to the national average of 3 percent.\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse has also estimated that 964,000 people age 12 and older, which account for about 0.4 percent of the total U.S. population, reported a methamphetamine use disorder in 2017, marking a significant increase from the previous year.\n\nThe governor's office didn't immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment.\n\nTags Kristi Noem South Dakota\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\nMost Popular\n\nVideo\n\nKrystal Ball issues warning to Biden supporters\nRising\nMost GOP voters say adoption agencies shouldn't be allowed to refuse same-sex couples\nRising\nSanders official predicts health care, climate change will be top issues in fifth Democratic debate\nRising\nBernie surrogate: Moderate candidates more frightened by Sanders than Trump\nRising\n\nMore From The Web\n\nDon't miss a brief.

It’s part of a larger pollution problem in India.\nSanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nAnother cloud of choking smoke and dust is set to descend upon the 20 million residents of Delhi this week, with forecasters warning that air pollution is likely to reach “severe” or “emergency” levels on Wednesday. The dangerous, dirty air is arising from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over India’s capital region.\n\nIt’s the latest wave of severe air pollution in recent weeks. Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter last month to describe his city as a “gas chamber.”\n\nDelhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring states\nIt is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt & govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today\nI urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaq\n\n— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) November 1, 2019\n\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public health emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to schoolchildren.\n\nLast week, some air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a rating of “hazardous.”\n\nAir pollution in Delhi remains “unhealthy” this week.\nBerkeley Earth\n\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and it’s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 — particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems — were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\n\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is worsening for Indians.\n\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance.\n\nWhy Delhi’s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\n\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in Delhi, there’s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\n\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\n\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi’s more than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors. Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the region’s total pollution. Dust from the city’s construction boom is also a contributor to the city’s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation.\n\nThese sources contribute to Delhi’s year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse now.\n\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\n\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year.\n\nThe air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks. pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\n\n— Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\n\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi’s pollution right now isn’t coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days.\n\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. “It’s like you’re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink that’s plugged up,” Apte said. “It overflows with spectacular consequences.”\n\nDelhi’s air wasn’t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.\n\n“I’m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,” said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. “The [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?”\n\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India’s breadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\n\nBurning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and harming air quality.\nSakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act.\n\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\n\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab’s water table. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat, which is typically sown mid-November.\n\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can’t hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting — burning crop stubble.\n\nThis satellite image from NASA’s worldview satellite shows fires detected (red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019.\nNASA Worldview\n\nOf course, it’s not just rural pollution that’s choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution — traffic, construction, cooking fires — have also increased as the region’s population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\n\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.\n\nDelhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action\n\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\n\nBrick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.\n\nIndia’s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires have continued, showing that enforcement is a problem, and farmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.\n\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it’s because of shifts in the weather — not policy.\n\n“This is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhi’s air to slightly improve,” Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News.\n\nOfficials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to schoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution.\nSonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. “Part of the challenge is that there’s a character of ‘Oh no, you first,’ ‘No, you first,’” Apte said. “No one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.”\n\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution — many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds.\n\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India’s last election cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\n“People will be up in revolt, they’ll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,” Prakash said. “It’s actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.”\n\nAir pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\n\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.\n\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\n\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\n\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds.\n\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better.\nEcological Economics\n\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that China’s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it gets done. The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\n“The beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,” Prakash said. “Nothing stands between the decision and the implementation.”\n\nThat’s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\n\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution.\n\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. “If one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,” Prakash said. It’s not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks.\n\nHeavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in Delhi.\nBiplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs.\n\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos, Nigeria. “The problem can be solved,” Prakash said. “But what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.”\n\nNext Up In Science & Health\n\nA clever new solar solution to one of the trickiest climate problems\nHow Apollo moon rocks reveal the epic history of the cosmos\nThese senators are going after the biggest climate villains in Washington\nBrazil’s Amazon rainforest destruction is at its highest rate in more than a decade\nTrump’s controversial vaping flavor ban is now dead\nWith impeachment, America’s epistemic crisis has arrived\n\nMost Read\n\nTuesday’s impeachment hearings were a disaster for Republicans Even their own witnesses said damaging stuff.\nOne of the Republicans’ witnesses confirmed a quid pro quo on TV This may be the biggest moment in the impeachment hearings so far.\nNunes keeps referring to the impeachment hearing as a “drug deal.” It’s not as clever as he thinks.

According to Reuters, the NYAG’s questions include if WeWork founder and former CEO Adam Neumann engaged in self-dealing.\n\nWeWork is headquartered in New York City. A company spokesperson said in an email that “we have received an inquiry from the office of the New York State Attorney General and are cooperating in the matter.” The New York State Attorney General’s office had no comment.\n\nThis comes less than a week after Bloomberg reported WeWork is the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into potential rule violations related to its cancelled IPO.\n\nWeWork’s parent company, The We Company, announced on Sept. 30 that it was withdrawing its S-1 filing for an initial public offering, shortly after Neumann stepped down as CEO. In addition to questions about the company’s financial state, red flags for investors included that Neumann had borrowed against his WeWork shares and leased properties he owned back to the company.\n\nAn entity Neumann controlled also sold the company the right to use the word “We” for $5.9 million, though he later asked the company to unwind the agreement and returned the money after public criticism.\n\nAfter receiving a lifeline from investor SoftBank worth up to $8 billion, WeWork is now engaging in major cost-cutting measures, including layoffs at Meetup, which it acquired for $200 million in 2017."

The main reason for the actual failure of the U.N. Plan is the failure of American side to fulfill its obligations. Despite numerous U.S. promises to influence the illegal armed groups under their control, the militants sabotaged early notifications of the planned action, limited the duration of the humanitarian convoy’s stay, engaged in extortion, and directly threatened families wishing to leave the camp.”\n\nSource: Russian Defense Ministry, October 25, 2019\nFalse\nInformation from multiple sources disputes the claims\n\nIn a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense ministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria’s al-Tanf of controlling “bandit formations” and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in the Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian government.\n\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as “patently false,” and both independent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the Russian and Syrian claims are false.\n\nThe al-Tanf base\n\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave Syria under President Donald Trump’s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S. military personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East observers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer “de-confliction zone” on the Baghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as an outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in order to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces. The U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\n\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\n\nThe Rukban camp\n\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syria’s border with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the country’s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross over to Jordan.\n\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan’s economy and infrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban crossing point.\n\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at around 40,000.\n\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to force the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\n“U.S.-controlled bandit formations”\n\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian opposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT – formerly the Free Syrian Army – to fight against Islamic State.\n\nOmar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based geopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018 that MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that the U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as \"certainly absurd.\"\n\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at Tufts University’s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the Russian Defense Ministry’s allegations are false.\n\n“I can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not ‘control’ any actors there directly,” Simpson said. “From my interviews, it appears all U.S. interventions in the region are indirect and sparse.”\n\n“… prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp”\n\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban camp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be identified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry’s claim is “absolutely not true.”\n\n“Not the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing civilians from leaving the camp,” the source said. “Many people are afraid to return to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They want a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.”\n\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry’s claim “is patently false,” and that “the United States is not preventing people from leaving Rukban.”\n\n“Rukban is another example of the Assad regime’s consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,” Robertson said.\n\nHe added: “The (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take responsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must continue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.”\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is “working in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said they need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary guarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure U.N. access to the shelters in Homs.”\n\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to leave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\n\n“Although Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into Jordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border security operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to civilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the region,” Simpson said. “This is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban, rather than returning to say, Palmyra.”\n\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: “The United States does not support forced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they are hungry.

The denials were in spite of the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City mansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for sex parties.\n\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is, the general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and disgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but “an articulated lorry crash” performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent media suspicions of culpability in Epstein’s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has left himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and evasions.\n\n“Prince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the royal family,” said one legal expert, as reported by the Independent newspaper.\n\n“His friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,” the expert warned.\n\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and contradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of alleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein’s “unbecoming” behavior (classic aloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an alibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18 years ago – on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a house in London belonging to Epstein’s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A photo of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\n\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited Epstein in New York in 2010 – after Epstein was released from prison for trafficking a minor for prostitution – in order to terminate his friendship.\n\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in person that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of friendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein’s orgy mansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\n\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with Epstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how vulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\n\nHe instead told the BBC interviewer: “I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him.”\n\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The rectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all this purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein contradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were “not close”.\n\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations punctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew’s otherwise “lack of remorse” or “sympathy” with the victims of Epstein’s sex abuse empire, as expressed in the BBC interview.\n\nLawyers for Epstein’s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview given by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by prosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-indictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for questioning.\n\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice from several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated media fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\n\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work, publicly-funded royals are.\n\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands War (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience allegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body sweating.\n\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Let’s see if he can keep his royal pants dry this time.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.\n\n...\nReddit\nGoogle+\nBlogger\nPinterest\nStumbleUpon\nTelegram\nWhatsApp\n55 3\nTrack Do not track Community standards Discussion\nComment via Facebook Comment via Sputnik\n\nСomment\n\nAdd Comment\nThank you!

Jangan cuma di kerongkongan.\nJangan lebay dalam mencintai atau membenci sesuatu. Biasa biasa saja. Jangan sampai karena kita amat membenci satu kaum, akhirnya kita justru menganiaya mereka secara keji / biadab:\n\n“…Dan janganlah sekali-kali kebencian(mu) kepada sesuatu kaum karena mereka menghalang-halangi kamu dari Masjidilharam, mendorongmu berbuat aniaya (kepada mereka)…” [Al Maa-idah 2]\n\n“… Dan janganlah sekali-kali kebencianmu terhadap sesuatu kaum, mendorong kamu untuk berlaku tidak adil. Berlaku adillah, karena adil itu lebih dekat kepada takwa…” [Al Maa-idah 8]\n\nKita harus hati2 terhadap aliran ekstrim “Penegak Sunnah” yang menanamkan kebencian yang amat sangat pada satu kaum sehingga akhirnya membantai kaum tsb dgn berbagai bom bunuh diri. Nabi dan para sahabat meng-Islam-kan Orang Kafir tanpa paksaan. Laa ikroha fid diin. Bukan membantai orang kafir.\n\nDari hadits Abu Hurairah ra, Rasulullah SAW bersabda :\n\nْﺐِﺒْﺣَﺃ َﻚَﺒﻴِﺒَﺣ ﺎًﻧْﻮَﻫ ﺎَﻣ ﻰَﺴَﻋ ْﻥَﺃ َﻥﻮُﻜَﻳ َﻚَﻀْﻴِﻐَﺑ ﺎًﻣْﻮَﻳ ،ﺎَﻣ\nْﺾِﻐْﺑَﺃَﻭ َﻚَﻀْﻴِﻐَﺑ ﺎًﻧْﻮَﻫ ﺎَﻣ ﻰَﺴَﻋ ْﻥَﺃ َﻥﻮُﻜَﻳ َﻚَﺒﻴِﺒَﺣ ﺎًﻣْﻮَﻳ\nﺎَﻣ\n\n“Cintailah orang yang kamu cintai sekadarnya. Bisa jadi orang yang sekarang kamu cintai suatu hari nanti harus kamu benci. Dan bencilah orang yang kamu benci sekadarnya, bisa jadi di satu hari nanti dia menjadi orang yang harus kamu cintai.”\n\n[HR. At-Tirmidzi no.1997 dan dishahihkan Asy-Syaikh Al-Albani\ndalam Shahih Al-Jami’ no. 178]\n\nUmar bin Al-Khaththab ra berkata, “Wahai Aslam, janganlah rasa cintamu berlebihan dan jangan sampai kebencianmu membinasakan.” Aslam berkata, “Bagaimana itu?” Umar radiallohu anhu berkata, “Jika engkau mencintai seseorang, janganlah berlebihan seperti halnya anak kecil yang menyenangi sesuatu dengan berlebihan. Jika engkau membenci seseorang, jangan sampai kebencian menimbulkan keinginan orang yang kamu\nbenci celaka atau binasanya.”\n\nAl-Hasan Al-Bashri ra berkata, “Hendaknya kalian mencintai jangan berlebihan dan membenci tidak berlebihan. Telah ada orang-orang yang berlebihan dalam mencintai satu kaum akhirnya binasa. Ada pula yang berlebihan dalam membenci satu kaum dan mereka pun binasa.”\n\n[Ni’matul Ukhuwah hal. 41]\n\nIklan\n\nShare this:\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nCetak\nSurat elektronik\nLagi\n\nLinkedIn\nTumblr\nReddit\nPinterest\n\nSukai ini:\n\nSuka Memuat...\n\nTerkait\n\nFiled under: Khawarij |\n\n« Najd (Arab Saudi) Serang Yaman dan Syam Location of Najd is in Iraq or in Najd? »\n\nSatu Tanggapan\n\nPembuat Film Fitna Dirikan Partai Islam Di Eropa | Berita Islami, on Desember 30, 2015 at 4:36 am said:\n\n[…] https://kabarislamia.com/2015/03/30/jangan-membenci-satu-kaum-secara-berlebihan/ […]\n\nBalas\n\nTinggalkan Balasan Batalkan balasan\n\nKetikkan komentar di sini...\n\nPlease log in using one of these methods to post your comment:\n\nSurel (wajib) (Alamat takkan pernah dipublikasikan)\nNama (wajib)\nSitus Web\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

A preview of the report was shared with paying subscribers.\n16-inch MacBook Pro's new scissor switch keyboard via iFixit\nThe report claims the display size will remain 13.3 inches, although given the source is DigiTimes, we would not completely rule out hopes of a larger 14-inch display. Wistron and Global Lighting Technologies are said to be among the suppliers of the keyboards for the smaller notebook.\nThe new 16-inch MacBook Pro features a redesigned scissor switch keyboard, largely based on the standalone Magic Keyboard for the iMac. Given the tried-and-tested design, the keyboard should prove far more reliable than the troublesome butterfly keyboards used across the MacBook lineup in recent years.\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro also features a physical Esc key and an inverted-T arrow key layout. It is unclear if the 13-inch MacBook Pro will follow suit.\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously predicted that Apple will transition its entire notebook lineup to scissor switch keyboards in 2020, including all MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models.\nIt would be hardly surprising if Apple completely moves past its butterfly keyboards, which have suffered from issues with sticky, repeating, or nonfunctional keys since their inception in 2016. Apple continues to offer free repairs to affected customers as part of its worldwide service program.\nThe entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro was last updated in July, while higher-end 13-inch models were refreshed in May.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Pro\nTag: digitimes.com\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\n[ 167 comments ]\n\nTop Rated Comments\n\n(View all)\n\nWoyzeck\n2 days ago at 07:52 am\nIt‘s good to see Apple un-iveing its products.\nRating: 36 Votes\nNick A\n2 days ago at 07:47 am\nI think we'll see similar updates to what the 16\" received. The bezels on the 13\" are large, and a 14\" display makes sense along with the magic keyboard, improved speakers and mics, and updated thermal design.\nEven if it increases the weight/thickness slightly, this is a \"Pro\" machine and I like the direction Apple is taking in that regard.\nRating: 25 Votes\nfmcshan\n2 days ago at 07:50 am\nIt would be nice if Apple switched to a 14” MacBook Pro with slimmer bezels just like they did with the 16” model.\nRating: 17 Votes\ntjedora\n2 days ago at 07:51 am\nShouldn't 2020 be the year of a \"complete\" redesign?\nRating: 12 Votes\nmike...\n2 days ago at 08:12 am\n\nNo surprise Apple is keeping the 13\". Kuo's also predicting the return of 15\" with scissor.\nIt makes the MacBook Pro lineup more complete.\n\n14\" and 16\" make more sense.\n14\", 15.4\", and 16\" makes no sense.\nRating: 10 Votes\nNick A\n2 days ago at 07:54 am\n\nShouldn't 2020 be the year of a \"complete\" redesign?\n\nI think this is it. The slimmer bezels, updated thermal design, and magic keyboard are the redesign, they just started it with the 16\". I think this is the design we've got until they move to mini-LED and ARM.\nEdit: I'm going to predict that a FaceID sensor with a upgraded camera is likely to come before the next redesign, but it's probably not going to be anytime soon or else we would have seen it in the 16\".\nRating: 9 Votes\nPickUrPoison\n2 days ago at 08:49 am\n\nIf we’re going to have the privelidge of getting a high quality brand new scissor switch mechanism, that no other laptop in the mark has, this better start at $2000 and no less. We don’t want cheap plastic laptops!!\n\nDidn’t we just go through this with the 16”—with the Apple-hate crowd predicting $3,500, $4,000 and even $5,000? Turns out we got a bigger screen AND a price cut.\nThere’s no reason to think a 13” with the new keyboard, whether it keeps the 13” display or moves up to 14”, will be any higher than the current $1,299/$1,799.\nRating: 9 Votes\nfalkon-engine\n2 days ago at 07:54 am\nIf they offer the new keyboard on a new 14 inch form factor, better radeon Navi graphics, and Wifi6, plus 32 GB of RAM, I might sign up.....\nRating: 7 Votes\nZdigital2015\n2 days ago at 08:51 am\n\nI agree but it begs the question...who the heck was/is in charge of the company...Ive or Cook?\n\nBefore he died, Steve Jobs gave Jony Ive a tremendous amount of veto power inside of Apple (Chief Design Officer) that I suspect has lead to an internal power struggle between the two and behind closed doors the MacBook Pro keyboard issues and Ive not keen to create yet another tower Mac pushed things to the breaking point. There is a correlation between the perceived decline in Apple’s focus on Macs and consumer’s needs, wants and desires, with the design direction that was taken in the 2016-2019 MacBook Pro, the lack of substantive updates to the Mac mini and the 2013 MacPro, as well as the hoopla over Jony Ive’s outside projects and dare I say it, weight gain, that leads me to believe that he was Ready to leave Apple back in 2015 after the Watch was released or even earlier and maybe he is or was suffering from some form of depression.\nAgain, this is conjecture on my part, I have no insider knowledge and only a few links to back up my assertions. But I’ve seen and lived parts of this before in my professional life. I suspect Ive was incredibly frustrated with Cook’s focus on costs, margin, supply chain, moving away from computers (although I think Ive was with him on that) and Cook’s relative lack of Deep caring or interest in the process of design, aesthetics, elegance...and that lead to a fractious working relationship. Steve balanced them out, acted as a buffer and took on the responsibility of making the final decisions, although I think he favored Ive’s arguments more times than anyone would admit. So to keep Cook, Jobs made him CEO and to balance it out, elevated Ive to CDO and gave him almost co-equal CEO power.\nThese sorts or working relationships are fragile, egocentric, mercurial and not prone to longevity. Ive no longer wants to be held back and these external projects were to try and give him a chance to spread his wings while retaining him as long as possible. The past 4-8 years are a result of this, I believe, we just have no transparency into any of Apple’s corporate drama.\nAgain, my opinion, my conjecture, my experiences. Thanks for letting me ramble on.\n[automerge]1574096160[/automerge]\n\nI sure wish Apple would offer the opportunity to upgrade the keyboards from the 2018 models to the new keyboard. I be happy to pay for the privilege. I had a chance to play with the new one this weekend, and it's much better feeling than the pounding-on-concrete version I have.\n\nDifferent chassis with different engineering, and that extra thickness is part of what is necessary to embed the scissors into the new 16”. Long story, short, a retrofit is not possible.\nBest situation is to sell your 15” and buy the 16” and stop pounding on concrete. Just my 2¢.\nRating: 7 Votes\nascender\n2 days ago at 08:58 am\n\nShouldn't 2020 be the year of a \"complete\" redesign?\n\nI think the new 16\" machine is the re-design - upgraded internals for improved thermal performance; new keyboard; speakers; mics; larger screen.\nThey've pretty much nailed the form factor of what we consider a laptop to be.\nRating: 6 Votes\n[ Read All Comments ]\n\nGuides\n\nNight Mode (iPhone 11)\n\nNight mode is an automatic setting which takes advantage of the new wide-angle camera that's in the ‌iPhone 11‌ and 11 Pro models.

These maps show where and how much.\nSkimming device found at Eagan Kwik Trip\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. — Hours before Zach Parise’s two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild coach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he always finds a way to start scoring.\n\n“It takes a little longer now, but he’s playing well now, he’s getting a little bit of confidence back,” Boudreau said before the Wild’s 4-1 win over the Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. “That goes a long way.”\n\nRight now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is brimming with confidence.\n\nParise’s first-period goals – he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56 – gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn’t relinquish.\n\nFor good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third period.\n\n“That’s perfect,” Boudreau said. “It’s the mark of a true competitor doing things for the team.”\n\nBarely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild defenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise’s penchant for changing sticks, could see the frustration on his friend’s face.\n\n“He’s used to scoring goals, getting points,” he said.\n\nBut Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just three four times in his first 18 games.\n\n“You can go either way,” Parise said. “I was going the other way for a little while. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.”\n\nParise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the neutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek’s feed on a two-on-one.\n\nHe tipped Suter’s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres.\n\n“He’s starting to feel it a little bit again,” Boudreau said. “And we need those goals.”\n\nThe Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been on his players to avoid looking at the standings.\n\n“It’s hard not to, though,” Suter acknowledged. “We know where we are, we know what we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step forward.”\n\nBoudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to “believe in yourselves” and that the Wild are a “good team.”\n\n“You’ve beaten some really good teams this year,” he said he said he told them. “You’ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start believing in yourself, then good things are going to happen.\n\n“I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because I knew they were a good team but they just weren’t playing good.”\n\nThe Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching start, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In the second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw punches, although neither player received a fighting major.\n\n“I didn’t really see him coming,” Eriksson Ek said. “He came off my back and, like, I just wasn’t ready for it.”\n\nParise said: “We’ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under their skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.”\n\nEichel said he was “just trying to spark some energy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan Dubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots. Sabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third period.\n\nDefenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason Zucker’s empty-net goal sealed it.\n\nThe Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an undisclosed injury.\n\n“I haven’t talked to the trainers at all,” Boudreau said.\n\nTags:\nMinnesota Wild\n\nBill Hoppe\n\nAs you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Join the IGN Deals Newsletter.\nWelcome to IGN's Daily Deals, your source for the best deals on the stuff you actually want to buy. Follow us at Twitter @igndeals. We bring you the best deals we've found today on video games, hardware, electronics, and a bunch of random stuff too. Updated 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Black Friday is approaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black Friday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday adscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\n\nPS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\n\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to Black Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the DualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its color and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to look grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.\n\nGet it on Amazon for 39.99\n\nNintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\n\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword or Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even on Black Friday).\n\nGet it at Walmart for $238.99\n\nKing of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R Curved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\n\nThis is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming monitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming monitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include a 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and 99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz refresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely love it, both for work and for games.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $649.99\n\nNew Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99 (Originally $200)\n\nScore the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll save $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most people probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates compared to the Series 3. What everyone will appreciate, though, is the extra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's waterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small, sleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $169.99\nAlso at Walmart\n\nNew Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139 (Originally $159)\n\nIt's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very popular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped today to the lowest price we've ever seen.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $139\nAlso at Walmart\n\n45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\n\nOne of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift card, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're essentially getting it for $499.\n\nGet it at Dell for $549\n\nDell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD for $799.99\n\nUse code \"50OFF699\"\nThis is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX 1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw performance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.\n\nUse code \"50OFF699\" to get it at Dell for $799.99\n\nNetgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\n\nClip the $10 off coupon on the product page\nThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and non-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive score and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk X4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters can't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds), anything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if you run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $67.77\n\nGet Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\n\nThis sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane.\nIf you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password) for every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites experiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to uncover your login info one day—and if you use the same credentials across multiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your sensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by randomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and automatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of the best password managers of 2019. Dashlane offers a free version of its software that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill functionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is available) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web Monitoring, and secure VPN.\n\nDownload Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n\n4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\n\nThis deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but you don't have to be a Prime member. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed, but it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make sure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.\n\nGet 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n\n$10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\n\nSave a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or Gray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is still $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.\n\nGet it at Walmart for $249.95\n\nNew Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with Bonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\n\nAfter a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian and Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the same titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are non-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch Pro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't play in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to play the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.\n\nGet it with Free Case at Walmart for $199.96\nGet it by itself on Amazon for $199\n\nNew Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon Credit\n\n\"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\" Read our Pokemon Sword and Shield review.\nIf you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has the best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if you get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but we confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it will end very, very soon so hurry!\n\nGet Pokemon Sword on Amazon for $58.99\nGet Pokemon Shield for $58.56\n\n70\" Element 4K UHD Smart HDTV with Roku for $499.99 (Originally $800)\n\nI think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday season. This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated Smart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for extended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart by January for whatever reason).\n\nGet it at Walmart for $499.99\n\n$15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\n\nThe new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and the upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with active noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to 5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets of silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell, and a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life. If you're hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you're fooling yourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go out of stock very soon.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $234.98\n\n30% Off LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Betrayal at Cloud City 2,812-Piece Set, Now $243.97\n\nThe 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\" wide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the \"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate Collector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary difference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability whereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever for the Cloud City set, and probably won't last.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $243.97\n\nDisney Plus is Now Live, Sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ Package and Save $5/Month\n\nDisney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription. This is also currently the only way to watch the new big Star Wars TV series, The Mandalorian, which airs starting today.\nIf you just want Disney+, you can sign up for a free 7-day trial. Afterwards you'll pay $6.99 per month. If you know you're in it for the long haul, then you can pay a $69.99 annual subscription fee, which saves you $14.\nAn even better deal is if you sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle. In that case you pay only $12.99. If you were to subscribe to all thee services separately, you'd be paying around $17.99 per month, so you'd be saving $60 every year.\nNote: The bundle includes Hulu with limited commercials. If you want ad-free Hulu, you will have to upgrade to it BEFORE signing up for the bundle plan. Here's the TL;DR version of signing up for ad-free Hulu as part of the Disney+ bundled package:\n\nSign up for a Hulu ad-free account for $11.99 a month\nIf you already have a Hulu account, visit your account page to upgrade\nSign up for the Disney+ bundle using the same email as your Hulu account\n\n______________________________\n\nEric Song is IGN's deal curator and spends 25% of his pay on stuff he posts.\nIf you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the sale.

While some people carry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their personal and professional tasks on the same device.\n\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are writing custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\n\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely proud of his company's trajectory on that front.\n\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has redefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"—and someone he's learned a lot from.\n\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\n\nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the Dreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote with a couple songs.\n\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he did an internship at the company.\n\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base as the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on mobile devices.\n\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don’t even own a computer anymore and I don’t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good job.\"\n\nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\n\nCook said the admiration is mutual.\n\n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly incorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told Benioff.\n\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba Buena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the same stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\n\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script in a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\n\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to exchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such a great leader.\n\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he passed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\n\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human right\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook said.\n\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally required to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while encouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\n\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to receive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they grew up after entering undocumented.\n\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love of their country and commitment to it.\"\n\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook said, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\n\nRelated Topics:\n\nSmart Phones\nCloud Software\nEnterprise Applications\n\nBack to Top\n\nrelated stories\n\nNews Cloud\n\nDrybar’s Rise To Success With NetSuite Has A Hidden Message For Partners\n\nNews Cloud\n\n‘Unmistakable Bias’: AWS Challenges Microsoft’s JEDI Cloud Win\n\nNews Cloud\n\n10 Emerging Cloud Computing Trends To Watch In 2020\n\nNews Cloud\n\n5 Key Announcements At Microsoft Ignite 2019\n\nNews Cloud\n\nRackspace Acquires Cloud-Native AWS Specialist Onica\n\ntrending stories\n\nVirtualization\n\nGartner’s Top 10 Technology Trends For 2020 That Will Shape The Future\n\nInternet of Things\n\n6 Emerging AI And Machine Learning Trends To Watch In 2020\n\nComponents & Peripherals\n\nHere Is The ‘Strictly Confidential’ Xerox Offer That HP Rejected\n\nSecurity\n\nThe 10 Top News Stories Of 2019 (So Far)\n\nData Center\n\nTop 12 Backup And Recovery Vendors: Gartner’s Magic Quadrant\n\nVideo\n\nVideo Player is loading.\nPlay Video\nPlay Next playlist item\nMute\nCurrent Time 0:00\n/\nDuration 0:00\nLoaded: 0%\nStream Type LIVE\nSeek to live, currently playing live LIVE\nRemaining Time - 0:00\nPlayback Rate\n\n1x\nChapters\n\nChapters\n\nDescriptions\n\ndescriptions off, selected\n\nSubtitles\n\ncaptions and subtitles off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was sentenced to life in federal prison.\n\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.\n\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\nTrending News\n\nVideo shows dramatic rescue of kidnapped girl: \"We got her!\"\nMan arrested after 7 trafficking victims found in car: Police\nJeffrey Epstein jail guards charged with falsifying records\nWhite teen accused of plotting deadly attack on black church\nSafety officials urge Boeing to redesign part on 737s\n\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.\n\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\n\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"\n\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.\n\nFirst published on November 19, 2019 / 8:16 AM\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

Now they’re starting to get attention here in the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even—heaven help us— booyah!. Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!. Cutting edge, I know.\n\nThese neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a cut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer deposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.\n\nTheir come-on is that they’re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile alternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they’re focused on their customers’ “financial health,” as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the “pain” that people feel around their money.\n\nWhat makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a little like a neo–payday loan—your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your actual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the companies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging any overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel a few dollars from your paycheck into savings.\n\nThese neo-banks aren’t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that facilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that are banks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown technology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course, on your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that they’re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.\n\nThe hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and researchers believe they’re cutting into millennials’ ability to buy homes, have kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have some credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the poorer you are, the more you’re likely to have.\n\nSo what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking services, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some basic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?\n\nBetter banking isn’t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There’s definitely an ambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy, bilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on the comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees, routinely discriminated against people of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really should be a mission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it’s smart to capitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.\n\nStill, it’s deeply depressing to attend a large gathering of executives, founders, and industry veterans, as I did at October’s Money 20/20 conference, and hear the same, somber message repeated over and over again: The future of money will be predicated on the fact that the personal finances of the next generation are as fragile as a Fabergé egg. This, according to attendees and speakers, is both a problem and an opportunity. No one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t technology’s problem to solve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the idea that the solution to our financial woes can be found in a more convenient, higher-tech, friendlier-named digital bank feels a little like the last story we heard from the tech industry: That the very idea of work could be disrupted by a bunch of apps, too.\n\nNo one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t technology’s problem to solve.\n\nThe same business logic—that you’re trapped in a sad, hellish existence dictated by megacorporations, and tech can free you like Neo from the Matrix—underlies the entire gig economy. It’s the basis for another tech veneer, this one layered over people’s inability to find meaningful work for reasonable pay. Uber got into the financial services game recently, with Uber Money. The headline feature? Real-time earnings for drivers and delivery people, so they can collect immediately, instead of weekly.\n\nIn fact, we can use the evolution of the gig economy as a case study for how the latest wave of banking disruption might play out.\n\nThere was a lot that was appealing about the gig economy at first. Those Uber “side hustle” commercials were super cool back in 2016, when driving for Uber or Lyft or Postmates, or shopping for TaskRabbit or letting out a room on Airbnb to cover your hiked-up rent, actually seemed like an opportunity rather than a necessity. Remember when this was about making “extra” money, instead of just barely enough?\n\nIt was only scale, and the hard realities of American economics, that made these things look a little less consumer-friendly a few years later. As Uber and Lyft grew, driver pay went down. Word got out that unicorn-like businesses could be built by replacing paid employees with a massive network of independent contractors. The model spread. Enter Lugg, Instacart, DoorDash, GrubHub, Prime Now, and Homejoy.\n\nThis phalanx of apps comprises an army of independent contractors who hope for enough tips to make their labor worthwhile. As their finances have cracked under the strain of small checks, no benefits, and a near-total lack of retirement savings, I guess it was only a matter of time before a fresh set of apps—the neo-banks—were deployed amid the chaos.\n\nI’d like to think the mission-driven companies flooding into the US market for financial services will be better for consumers. In the short term, that seems plausible. Cool features, fewer fees, and a helpful person on the phone or online chat could make us happy. Let’s not forget, many people really hate big banks and would rather take their business elsewhere.\n\nBut there are two problems with this potential disruption.\n\nOne, it might not end up being so consumer-friendly in the long run. Uber and Lyft ended up paying drivers less as their revenue pressure grew, and they’re raising prices for consumers. Many riders will tell you the quality of the driving, the cars, and the experience has declined over time, which is both inevitable with growth and not surprising given the shrinking pay and incentives.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nSubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\n\nThat will almost certainly also be the case with these neo-banks. Banks won’t lie down and let the disruption happen—they’ll almost certainly buy some of these upstarts and reabsorb reluctant customers. Big Tech incumbents are already honing in on the space. Apple’s (issue-laden) credit card, Amazon’s small business loans and unknown future ambitions, Google’s forthcoming consumer checking accounts, and Facebook’s payment wallets could all eat into the market for new companies.\n\nWhether it’s due to competition from banks, each other, or bigger tech companies, neo-bank startups will inevitably go out of business, leaving consumers stranded. That’s pretty disruptive when you’re talking about your checking account. And at some point, the neo-banks will have to make more money, which means their offerings will get less generous over time.\n\nA second problem is more serious. Ultimately, no amount of friendly design, accessible features, and overdraft protections will solve the underlying problems that made these services necessary in the first place. No neo-bank can erase the student loan debt or the 40-year stagnation in wages or the unexpected medical expenses or the crippling reality of America’s existential brokeness. The neo-banks have promised that they’ll ease your pain, but that’s just morphine for the real condition. When it comes to the actual sickness, you’re still on your own.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\nYouTubers must unionize, no matter what Google says\nPaid political ads are not the problem.

The 180 page coffee-table publication comes with a 10-inch vinyl featuring seven classic rock tracks, including Born to be Wild and The Road to Hell. While we all know vinyl is best, there’s also a download code to get all the tracks as 256kps MP3s.\n\nAdvert\n\nAs I write this review, listening to the Bike & Style soundtrack and flicking through the book again, the idea, from Ear Books in Germany, makes brilliant sense. Classic rock may seem something of a cliché for bikers, but looking at shots of Freddie Spencer and Evel Knievel whilst listening to Steppenwolf makes me want to get out on the bike.\n\nThere are some stunning photos in the book, but it’s disappointing to also find a few low-resolution images spoiling the quality impression, as well as some design touches that intrude a little too much.\n\nThis isn’t a book for fact-fiends (and being bi-lingual, half the space is taken up by the German version of the text), but it’s full of iconic bikes, people and kit (though where are Lewis Leathers?!). It’s a very enjoyable title to leaf through whenever you want to remember how cool you are.\n\nAdvert\n\n[button link=”http://www.morebikes.co.uk/submit-kit-review/” type=”big” newwindow=”yes”] Send us YOUR kit review[/button]\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nGet Motor Cycle Monthly delivered through your letterbox every month. 12 issues for £11.99.

Carlos Nadalim apresenta, neste vídeo, uma loja incrível nos EUA, repleta de materiais didáticos, livros e uma quantidade enorme de recursos educativos para crianças. Por que não temos uma assim no Brasil?\n\nAqui nos Estados Unidos você tem à disposição materiais voltados à aquisição da fluência em leitura. Há vários materiais, mas quero destacar um: um cronômetro para que pais e professores saibam quantas palavras seus filhos e alunos estão lendo por minuto.\n\nIsso é muito importante, porque a aquisição da fluência em leitura levará as crianças à compreensão de textos. É por isso que aqui você vai também encontrar materiais voltados à compreensão de leitura. Ou seja, uma coisa está conectada à outra.\n\nNo Brasil isso não é muito comum. Quando você fala sobre fluência de leitura, o pessoal estranha: “Que história é essa de que uma criança de 6 anos deve ler 60 palavras por minuto? Que absurdo é esse? Cada criança tem seu tempo”.\n\nSó que não é isso o que a ciência cognitiva da leitura diz a respeito de compreensão textual.\n\nOutra coisa interessante aqui: a abordagem fônica é algo comum para o americano. Você encontra uma variedade de materiais para pais que querem preparar seus filhos para a alfabetização a partir, por exemplo, dos 3 anos.\n\n“Mas 3 anos, Prof. Carlos? Não é muito cedo? As crianças precisam brincar. Onde já se viu inseri-las no universo das letras, dos sons, etc.”\n\nPois bem, aqui nos Estados Unidos isso é muito comum, e acontece de forma lúdica.\n\n“ 3 anos, 3 anos, 3 anos… ” Veja, isso é tão natural aqui! “ 3 anos, 3 anos, 3 anos… ” Ninguém discute isso, pois todos sabem que é muito importante preparar as crianças para a alfabetização formal por meio de jogos, de atividades lúdicas, que vão fortalecer a memória, a consciência fonológica, a consciência fonêmica, e assim por diante.\n\nEntão veja como os brasileiros ainda estão discutindo e vendo problemas em coisas que aqui são comuns, divertidas e que só melhoram o desempenho das crianças, no futuro, em leitura e escrita.\n\nTudo isso que estou dizendo é muito comum aqui também para os professores que trabalham na pré-escola. Estou aqui numa seção de recursos de ensino, na qual há vários professores comprando materiais que eles utilizam com seus alunos em sala de aula.\n\nEntão é isso!\n\nEspero que você tenha gostado de conhecer alguns dos materiais desta loja e também que você afaste definitivamente de sua cabeça essas idéias tolas sobre preparação de crianças pequenas para a alfabetização.\n\nUm forte abraço, fique com Deus e até a próxima.\n\nDeixe suas dúvidas e opiniões aqui embaixo!

        "articleBody": "'The Medium is the Message': the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival | Inexhibit\n\nHOME\nArchitecture\nDesign\nArt\nCities\nmyMuseum\nSpecials\nEnglish\n\nItalian\n\n‘The Medium is the Message’: the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n\nBy admin - 2018-09-16\n\nAs of 29 November 2018, thirty artworks will light up the city center of Amsterdam for the seventh year in a row. For this years’ edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme ‘The Medium is the Message’. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition – in the historical center of Amsterdam – which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\n\nCover image: artist’s impression of the lighting installation by Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\n\nIvana Jelić and Pavle Petrović (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh’s famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\n\nGroupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\n\nAmigo & amigo (Australia) – also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua – explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\n\nOGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\n\nBalmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio’s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli, Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct?\n\nLight as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years’ exhibition revolves around the theme ‘The Medium is the Message ‘, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories is also a central part of this edition.\nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of remarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be released as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn identifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\nSome of the lighting installations on show at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival – previews\n\nLight a Wish by OGE Group\n\nParabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo\n\nPortam Civitatis by Peter Snijder\n\nSpider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS\n\n7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019\n\nsponsored links\n\nMore in Amsterdam\n\nAmsterdam\n\nsponsored links\n\nSearch Inexhibit\n\nInDi Design Index\n\nSpecials\n\nThe design of everyday technology\n\nVisionary computer design of the past\n\nExamples of digital communication technology in culture and education\n\nVenice Art Biennale 2017 | info, program, exhibitions, and events\n\nWood Architecture & Design\n\n58th Venice Biennale of Art 2019 | May You Live in Interesting Times\n\nMuseums of archaeology and archaeological sites around the world\n\n16th Venice Architecture Biennale 2018 – pavilions, program, events\n\nVenice Architecture Biennale 2016 – Reporting from the Front – INDEX\n\nVenice Art Biennale 2015 – All the World’s Futures – Index\n\nrecently-added locations\n\nMantua and Cremona\n\nNaples and Campania\n\nChicago\n\nSan Francisco\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nTurin\n\nDallas – Fort Worth\n\nInnsbruck and Austrian Tyrol\n\nSubscribe to Inexhibit’s newsletter\n\ncopyright Inexhibit 2019 - ISSN: 2283-5474\n\nAbout Inexhibit\nCopyright\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nCookies\nNewsletter\nCookie policy\n\nHOME\nArchitecture\nDesign\nArt\nCities\nmyMuseum\nSpecials\nEnglish\n\nItalian"

(NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute)\nSPACE\n\nThe First Map of Saturn's Moon Titan Just Revealed Some Tantalising Features\n\nREUTERS\n19 NOV 2019\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn's moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of frozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic world considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\n\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System's second-biggest moon behind Jupiter's Ganymede. It is larger than the planet Mercury.\n\nOrganic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living organisms - play a leading role on Titan.\n\n\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many of us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's icy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\n\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and this can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added Lopes, who led the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe first global geologic map of Titan. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU)\n\nOn Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On Titan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on Earth - in liquid form due to the moon's frigid climate.\n\nRainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than the poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency research fellow.\n\nPlains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of the surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate Titan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.\n\nTitan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids on the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at its polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed portions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\n\n\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more complex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep subsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.\n\nNoting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a hydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something like it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a little warmer?\"\n\nThe map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch its Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's chemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\n\n\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying around on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"\n\n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown)\n\n© Reuters"

One of Alibaba’s New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.\n\nThe Chinese company’s decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-violent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing in the city’s status as a Asian financial hub.\n\nIt is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba’s initial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then accept the company’s unusual governance structure.\n\nSmall investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many shares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can get, Reuters reported.\n\nRead more: Tencent profit falls as Alibaba threat and economic woes weigh\n\nHong Kong’s exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.\n\nAlibaba’s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange next Tuesday.\n\nMain image credit: Getty\n\nShare\n\nTags: Alibaba\n\nRelated articles\n\nAlibaba’s secondary Hong Kong listing gets exchange approval\n\nAnna Menin\n\nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba eyes $15bn Hong Kong listing in boost for troubled city\n\nJames Booth\n\nAlibaba poised to launch record-breaking $13.4bn Hong Kong listing\n\nAnna Menin\n\nBusiness\nIndustries\nMarkets\nTechnology\nLeadership\nLife & Style\nMoney\nSport\n\nFollow us for breaking news and latest updates:\n\nStay up to date:\nSign up to our daily newsletters\nEmail\nNewsletters\n\nFive at 5\nMidday Update\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nLatest Edition\n\nCopyright © 2019 CityAM.

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\n\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\n\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nTransportation\nTravel\nEmerging markets\nTrade\nAirbus Group SE\n\nRelated\n\nOrders for Boeing's embattled 737 Max pick up at Dubai Air Show\nBoeing clinches second Dreamliner order at Dubai Air Show but trails Airbus in deals\nWill hyperloop threaten aviation?

The demand has US officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\n\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\n\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\n\nTrump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\n\nDH Newsletter Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\nGET IT\nUnited States\nChina\ntrade war\nTrade deal\n0 Comments (+)\n\nRelated stories\n\nIndia plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\n\nDollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK\n\nChina cuts new benchmark rate to boost economy\n\nKhamenei says enemy 'repelled' in protest-hit Iran\n\nBeijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\nLast campus protesters hold out as HK schools reopen...\n\nDH Picks\n\nPSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr...\n\nKarnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n\nKPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams...\n\nBullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n\nSocial audits key to finding issues in govt schemes...\n\nsocial feed\n\nWhat does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\nPolitics\nNorth and Central\nSouth\nEast and Northeast\nWest\n\nKarnataka\n\nTop Stories\nPolitics\nDistricts\n\nBengaluru\n\nTop Stories\nBengaluru Crime\nPolitics\nInfrastructure\nLife in the City\n\nSports\n\nCricket\nICC World Cup 2019\nFormula 1 with DH\nFootball\nTennis\nSportscene\nOther Sports\n\nBusiness\n\nBusiness News\nBudget 2019\nEconomy & Business\nFamily Finance\nTechnology\nDH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\nVideos\nPhotos\n\nOpinion\n\nDH Views\nEditorials\nPanorama\nComment\nIn Perspective\nRight in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\nEntertainment News\nDH Talkies\nArts, Books & Culture\n\nMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\nKarnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\nIndia vs Bangladesh\n\nChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\nAyodhya verdict\n\nPegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\nDH Picks\n\nPSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep\nKarnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\nKPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\nBullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\nSocial audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\nLatest stories\n\nIndia plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\nDollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK\nBlood-stained dress of Congress MLA in Kerala Assembly\nNCLAT rejects DBS Bank's plea\nArrests ordered in Philippines vaping ban\n\nTrending news\n\nIrked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\nAnil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\nTech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\nStents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\nGunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\nServices\n\nAbout\nEpaper\nNewsletter\nArchives\nSitemap\nClassifieds\nContact\n\nOur group sites\n\nPrinters Mysore\nPrajavani\nSudha\nMayura\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms\nDisclaimer\n\n© 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\nX Share via\n\nShare permalink\n\nWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology.\n\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\n\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nRelated: From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through Time\n\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project, which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\n\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"\n\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\n\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"\n\nThe violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures (in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel cosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\n\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.\n\nRelated: The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe\n\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.\n\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"\n\n15 Amazing Images of Stars\n11 Fascinating Facts About Our Milky Way Galaxy\nThe 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark Matter\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n\nNeed more space?

Господи, какие только темы я не придумывал. Но точно знал, что из всех моих хобби не брошу только одно: не перестану есть. Поэтому я запустил блог, в котором рассказываю то, что сам узнаю о еде (потом добавил путешествия).\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Очень люблю этот вопрос, потому что всегда отвечаю одно и то же: я люблю вкусную кухню. Это может быть борщ, индийская курица карри или скандинавские смореброды, китайские сушеные скорпионы или корейская жгучая кимчи. Если вкусно, значит, это моя кухня. Люблю почти все, особенно, конечно, десерты. Но довольно холодно отношусь ко всяким смузи, не люблю сало и надеюсь когда-нибудь понять оливки.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Думаю, это будет паста. Банально, но зато всегда работает. Соусом и начинкой послужит то, что будет в холодильнике. Сам я люблю потереть хороший сыр, добавить молотого перца и немного томатного соуса. Если будет позволять время, тальятелли приготовлю сам.\n\nПроголосовать за Андрея вы можете на последней странице!\n\nОлеся Куприн\n\nФото:\nличный архив Олеси Куприн\n\nАккаунт: @okuprin\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Еда объединяет. Где бы мы ни оказались, даже не зная языка, за одним столом с другими людьми мы всегда найдем о чем поговорить.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Я очень любою шоколад: горький, молочный, белый, пористый, с орехами, самый разный! Но зато не могу пережить манные комочки и рассольник с грустными огурцами.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Томатный киш. Дома мы никогда не готовили традиционный киш со сливками и прочими вкусными жирностями. За основу, разумеется, бралось песочное тесто, а вот начинкой служил творожный сыр и самые разные овощи, иногда киш случался с мясом, чаще с рыбой, но самый любимый был именно с помидорами. Для основы: 2 желтка, 150 г сливочного масла комнатной температуры, 30 г сахара, 200 г муки. Для начинки: 300 г творожного сыра, 300 г мягкого творога, он своей консистенцией похож на сметану, 2 яйца, 2−3 томата для начинки, соль и специи по вкусу.\n\nПриготовление: желтки разотрите с сахаром, затем вмешайте к ним сливочное масло, оно должно подтаять при комнатной температуре и стать мягким как крем. К готовой консистенции просейте муку, вымешайте гладкое однородное тесто. Тесто заверните в пленку, и уберите в холодильник на 1 час. По истечению времени выньте тесто, разомните его и выложите в форму, распределите равномерно руками прямо в форме для выпечки. Этого количества хватит на два небольших киша по 16−18 см или один большой 25−26 см. Перед запеканием тесто наколите вилкой, чтобы оно не поднималось в форме, а затем запекайте основу для киша при 180 градусах 12−15 минут. Ориентируйтесь по своей плите. Пока запекается основа смешайте сыр, творог, яйца, соль и специи, можно использовать миксер на невысокой скорости. Помидоры нарежьте кольцами, если используете черри их можно положить целиком. Как только основа будет готова, выньте ее из духовки и охладите 8−10 минут на столе. Основа не должна пропечься полностью или затвердеть, тесто станет нужной консистенции при остывании. В остывшую основу залейте творожную смесь, выложите помидоры и снова уберите форму с кишем в духовку, еще на 15−18 минут, чтобы творожная масса схватилась. Готовый киш выньте из духовки, он должен полностью остыть в форме, затем его уже можно будет нарезать для подачи.\n\nПроголосовать за Олесю вы можете на последней странице!\n\nЕвгения Левицкая\n\nФото:\nличный архив Евгении Левицкой\n\nАккаунт: @evgenialevi\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Я всегда любила готовить. Мне даже больше нравится сам процесс приготовления блюда, а еще очень люблю собирать друзей и угощать своими шедеврами.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Три года прожила во Вьетнаме, и я просто фанат азиатской кухни. К сожалению, в России не все блюда можно реализовать на кухне обычной домохозяйки, но если есть возможность, то никогда не откажусь от вьетнамских блинчиков с морепродуктами и супчика фо.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Буратта с овощами и томатным соусом. Казалось бы, обычные продуты: баклажан, цукини, буратта и томатный соус, а столько комплиментов я давно не получала. Вам потребуется: 1 баклажан, 1 цукини, зубчик чеснока, 1 шарик буратты, 200 мл томатной пассаты. Овощи очистить от кожуры и порезать на мелкие кубики. На сковородку налить оливковое масло, добавить чеснок (слегка придавив его ножом), обжарить баклажаны до золотистой корочки. Потом добавить цукини, немного еще масла и снова пожарить. Посолить, поперчить. В это время в сотейник вылить пассату (можно заменить томатами в собственном соку, только блендером превратите в пюре). Поставить на сильный огонь, дать закипеть, убрать огонь и выпаривать, пока томаты не станут консистенции соуса. Посолить, поперчить, добавить оливковое масло и смесь итальянских трав. На тарелку с глубоким дном выкладываем овощи, сверху соус и буратту. Подавать с кусочками хрустящего багета.\n\nПроголосовать за Евгению вы можете на последней странице!\n\nДинара Снижевская\n\nФото:\nличный архив Динары Снижевской\n\nАккаунт: @dinara_snizhevskaya\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— В моей семье нет ни одного человека, не умеющего и не любящего готовить! По традиции каждые выходные мы собираемся всей семьей, чтобы вкусно поесть и поделиться новостями. Думаю, что на выбор направления в фотографии повлияла масса теплых и уютных воспоминаний, связанных с едой!\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Поскольку часть детства я прожила в Узбекистане, мои вкусовые предпочтения сформировались там. Я люблю узбекскую кухню с ее пестрым разнообразием и насыщенностью, и, конечно же, чуть более сдержанную русскую. Со временем мне полюбились такие же яркие и насыщенные блюда итальянской и паназиатской кухонь.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Всякий раз, когда необходимо быстро приготовить вкусный ужин, я готовлю жареный рис по-китайски. Быстро, очень ароматно и необычайно вкусно! Для этого вам нужно: отварной рис – 1,5 стакана, 1 луковица, 1 столовая ложка мелко натертого корня имбиря, 300 граммов куриного филе, упаковка смеси любимых замороженных овощей, 15−20 мл соевого соуса, 3 шт. зеленого лука. Разогрейте в сковороде подсолнечное масло, мелко нарежьте лук, чеснок и обжарьте до золотистого цвета с имбирем. Нарежьте соломкой курицу, добавьте к луку и обжаривайте еще 5−6 минут, помешивая. Затем добавьте замороженные овощи и обжаривайте еще 5−6 минут. Когда смесь станет румяной, всыпьте рис, влейте соевый соус и жарьте еще 5 минут. Готовое блюдо украсьте зеленым луком, нарезанным наискосок.\n\nПроголосовать за Динару вы можете на последней странице!\n\nОксана Луцан\n\nФото:\nличный архив Оксаны Луцан\n\nАккаунт: @bittereschokolade\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— История моего увлечения началась с выпечки. Сначала меня захватил полностью мир кондитерского искусства, потом появилось желание снимать то, что готовлю. Так открыла для себя мир фудфотографии.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Не могу отдать предпочтение какой-то определенной кухне, очень нравится находить новые рецепты и сочетания продуктов. Я много путешествую и каждый раз привожу интересные идеи.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Когда продукты вкусные и свежие их хочется минимально подвергать какой-то тепловой обработке. Крупно нарежьте болгарский перец, кабачок кружками, шампиньоны разрежьте пополам, сбрызните все оливковым маслом, добавьте немного лимонного сока, соль и свежемолотый перец. Отдельно смешайте оливковое масло, ложку лимонного сока, чайную ложку горчицы, соль по вкусу. Хорошо смажьте стейк форели или семги. Выложите рыбу с овощами на решетку и запекайте в духовке в режиме гриль около 20 минут. Быстрый, вкусный и полезный ужин готов!\n\nПроголосовать за Оксану вы можете на последней странице!\n\nОльга Панкова\n\nФото:\nличный архив Ольги Панковой\n\nАккаунт: @olga_n_photo\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Два моих самых любимых увлечения – фотография и кулинария. В какой-то момент они соединились в одно направление – фуд-фотографию, и я с азартом окунулась в эту новую необычайно увлекательную работу. Меня бесконечно вдохновляет еда! Любая. Готовые блюда, ингредиенты, их сочетания, специи, кулинарные травы, напитки и все, что может быть с этим связано.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Не могу сказать, что люблю какую-то одну кухню. Скорее есть любимые блюда в разных кухнях мира. Это могут быть и итальянская паста вонголе, и узбекский плов, и белорусские драники, и французский хлеб, и десерты. А от русской жареной картошки с селедкой я точно никогда не откажусь! Мечтаю попробовать все кухни мира. Равнодушно отношусь только к мясу и без труда смогу без него прожить.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\nДля вкусного семейного ужина у меня есть фирменный рецепт, который однажды я сама придумала и восхитилась результатом. Но потом в интернете нашла информацию, что такой рецепт уже давно существует во французской кухне. Это дорада, запеченная в листьях лука порея с лаймом и травами. Рыба получается очень нежная, ароматная, тает во рту. На все меньше 30 минут. А пока рыба запекается, я успеваю приготовить гарнир, например, отварить рис и приготовить салат. На 2 порции вам понадобится 1 лук порей, 1 лайм, несколько веточек свежего тимьяна, 2−3 ч. л. прованских трав, 2 ст. л. оливкового масла, соль и молотый черный перец по вкусу. Разогреть духовку до 180 градусов. Противень застелить пергаментом для выпечки. Рыбу очистить, выпотрошить, хорошо промыть внутри и снаружи, обсушить. Натереть смесью из оливкового масла, соли, черного перца и прованских трав. Снять с порея несколько верхних листьев и обдать их горячей водой, чтобы они стали более гибкими. Оставшийся стебель порезать небольшими кольцами, выложить на противень. Нарезать лайм тонкими кольцами. Фаршировать рыбу лаймом, веточками тимьяна. Затем на рыбу положить по 1−2 веточки свежего тимьяна, и завернуть каждую в листы порея. Выложить на противень, сбрызнуть оливковым маслом и запекать в духовке, в течение 30−35 минут. Подавать незамедлительно.\n\nПроголосовать за Ольгу вы можете на последней странице!\n\nВенера Осепчук\n\nФото:\nличный архив Венеры Осепчук\n\nАккаунт: @venera_os\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Кулинария – мое хобби в свободное время от работы и семьи. Я также как и многие ненавижу ежедневную рутинную готовку, но зато очень люблю в свой выходной день выбрать какое-нибудь новое блюдо, которое мы еще не пробовали, закупить нужных продуктов, приготовить и красиво сфотографировать. Это, можно сказать, моя такая медитация и релакс – я кайфую от этого процесса и получаю удовольствие.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Очень люблю восточную кухню! Здесь на первом месте блюда турецкой и татарской кухни, из азиатской – тайская кухня у нас в фаворитах, а из европейской – всеми любимая средиземноморская! В общем, вы поняли, поесть мы любим.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Хочу поделиться идеей для быстрого и вкусного ужина! Паста с тунцом, в томатном соусе готовится моментально и просто – за какие-то 20−30 минут. Понравится всем однозначно, так как к пасте мало равнодушных. На 4 порции вам понадобятся: спагетти – 370 г, 3 ст. л. оливкового масла, мелко нарезанная петрушка – 3 ст. л., 2−3 зубчика чеснока, 1 маленький перец чили, 1,5 см корня имбиря, тунец консервированный в масле – 400 гр., пассата (консервированная мякоть томатов) – 450−500 г, сахар – 0,5−¾ ч. л., соль и черный перец по вкусу. Спагетти отварить, чеснок, перец чили и петрушку мелко нарубить, имбирь натереть на мелкой терке. В сотейнике разогреть оливковое масло, добавить подготовленные овощи и зелень – жарить все буквально 1−2 минутки. Влить томатную пассату, дать закипеть. Посолить, поперчить, добавить сахар по вкусу и варить 3−5 минут. Тунца вынуть из банки и вилкой разломать на грубые куски (не мельчить), затем добавить их в томатный соус, дать закипеть, если нужно – еще досолить, доперчить. Положить готовые спагетти, перемешать, прогреть и подавать. Подаем присыпав свежей петрушкой и черным молотым перцем.\n\nПроголосовать за Венеру вы можете на последней странице!\n\nДарья Калугина\n\nФото:\nличный архив Дарьи Калугиной\n\nАккаунт: @contrse\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Задолго до увлечения фудфотографией я занималась портретной и художественной съемкой. Тогда меня интересовали только люди, с их характерами и выражениями самых разных эмоций. Но в какой-то момент я поняла, что вопреки имеющемуся мнению, мастерства и желания фотографа создать интересный снимок недостаточно, нужна модель, умеющая работать перед камерой. Мне одновременно нужно было больше пространства для вдохновения и больше контроля над композицией, светом и сюжетом. Я всегда любила еду, в моей семье был некий негласный гастрономический культ со сложносочиненными блюдами на завтрак, обед и ужин. Видимо, неизбежным было пересечение двух моих любимых занятий: снимать и есть (ладно, еще готовить!). Мой девиз: «Надо любить то, что делаешь, и делать то, что любишь», иначе результат будет без души.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Я обычно отвечаю так: «Ем все, кроме устриц». Вкус устриц пусть останется навсегда в долгой-долгой памяти. Мне нравится экспериментировать с едой. Я пробовала много разного и экзотического, и в кухне любой страны обязательно есть по крайней мере одно запоминающееся блюдо, один яркий вкус, который оставил неизгладимый след в моей душе гурмана.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Я сразу подумала о рыбе дорада. В моей семье это традиционное блюдо на ужин выходного дня под бокал белого вина и веселые разговоры. Получается всегда безумно вкусно, нежно и изысканно, а готовится практически с закрытыми глазами. Самое главное – выбрать хорошую рыбу. Лучше всего покупать охлажденную, а не мороженую. Глаза должны быть чистыми, прозрачными и выпуклыми, а жабры иметь ярко-розовый, даже красноватый цвет. В противном случае, рыба уже не первой свежести, а второй, как известно, не бывает. Можно сразу в магазине попросить, чтобы рыбу выпотрошили. Чистить ее не надо. Измельчите розовую и белую соль и натрите рыбу с обеих сторон (не внутри). Тонко нарежьте лимон и 2−3 кружка положите внутрь рыбы, и несколько сверху. По желанию можете добавить пару веточек свежего розмарина или тимьяна. Мне нравится натуральный вкус дорада, поэтому я вообще не добавляю специи. Поставьте в разогретую до 190 градусов духовку на 20−30 минут (в зависимости от размера рыбы и типа духовки). Мясо готовой рыбы будет легко отделяться от костей. Получается безумно нежно, вкусно и ароматно, буквально тает во вру!\n\nПроголосовать за Дарью вы можете на последней странице!\n\nОльга Аветисьянц\n\nФото:\nличный архив Ольги Аветисьянц\n\nАккаунт: @olga_avet\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— К фудфотографии я пришла через увлечение кулинарией. А началось все с рождением дочери. Когда она чуть подросла, мы много времени проводили на кухне вместе. Создавали свои кулинарные истории, ароматом которых должно быть наполнено детство.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Любимой кухней является итальянская. Предпочтению всегда отдам морепродуктам. Не могу назвать какие-то продукты, которые я категорически не ем, все зависит от того, как это приготовлено.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Каждую пятницу мы готовим пиццу. Домашнюю, самую вкусную. Уверяю вас, дома можно приготовить потрясающую пиццу с хрустящей корочкой. Для теста вам понадобятся: 250 мл теплой воды, 400 г муки, 2 ч. л. сухих дрожжей (или 20 г свежих), 2 ст. л. сахара, 1 ч. л. соли, 3 ст. л. оливкового масла. Дрожжи растворите в теплой воде, добавьте сахар и подождите, пока поднимется пенная шапка. Смешайте с остальными ингредиентами. Замесите тесто (я использую миксер с насадкой крюк). Поставьте его в теплое место на 30−40 минут и накройте пленкой. Данного кол-ва теста хватит на 2 пиццы (диаметр 26 см). Выпекайте пиццу в предварительно разогретой духовке на 300 градусов около 10 минут. Для лучшего результата выпечки используйте пекарский камень. Для томатного соуса вам понадобятся томаты в собственным соку (либо очищенные, либо уже пюрированные) – 500 г. Томаты необходимо потушить с оливковым маслом (пару столовых ложек добавить) и специями (базилик, розмарин, тимьян, любые на ваш вкус) на среднем огне 10−15 минут. Можно добавить пару столовых ложек сахара, если соус будет кислым (это зависит от самих томатов). Раскатать тесто для пиццы, смазать соусом, выложить тертую моцареллу (твердую), сулугуни (или брынзу, можно еще моцареллу шариками), колбасу. Помним, что оливки, прошутто не выпекаются, они выкладываются на готовую пиццу. Подавать пиццу следует теплую с зеленью (базилик, руколла, шпинат).\n\nПроголосовать за Ольгу вы можете на последней странице!\n\nКатерина Каплар\n\nФото:\nличный архив Катерины Каплар\n\nАккаунт: @katya_kaplar\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Я занялась фудфотографией в декрете, мне очень не хотелось выходить в офис. При этом у меня была очень хорошая работа в рекламном агентстве, но стены меня душили, и я это всегда осознавала. Тем более, все мои друзья говорили мне, что у меня хорошо получается создавать композиции, снимать еду, при этом я делала это на телефон. Могу смело сказать, что меня вдохновили мои друзья и близкие люди. Муж подарил фотоаппарат с объективом и потом уже не было ни дня, чтобы я не снимала еду. Хочу отметить, что я сейчас не только фудфотограф, но и организатор мастер-классов по фуд фотографии, которые с успехом проходят уже в который раз (за весну, лето и осень прошло уже 7 успешных мастер классов!).\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Я люблю итальянскую и испанскую кухню. Обожаю сыры, пиццу, пасту и обязательно на столе должно быть много сочных овощей и вкусное вино.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Делюсь рецептом теста для пиццы. Все до безобразия просто: 175 г муки, соль по вкусу, сахар по вкусу, 1 ч. л. сухих дрожжей, 1 ст. л. оливкового масла, 125 мл теплой воды. Смешать в блендере соль, сахар, дрожжи, муку. Постепенно добавить воду и масло, перемешать блендером, а потом месить руками пару минут, добавляя муку, чтобы не прилипало тесто к рукам. Положить в миску, обмазать оливковым маслом, обернуть миску полотенцем и оставить на 1 час, чтоб тесто поднялось в два раза. Потом раскатываете и добавляете ингредиенты: соус из вяленных томатов и оливкового масла (все это перемалываю в блендере), томаты черри, моцарелла, пармезан – да что угодно! По готовности уже добавляю листья салата, оливковое масло и еще чуть сыра. Готовила на 200−250 градусах минут 15−20, но тут надо уже самой смотреть – у кого какая плита.\n\nПроголосовать за Катерину вы можете на последней странице!\n\nЭмма Матевосян\n\nФото:\nличный архив Эммы Матевосян\n\nАккаунт: @delicious_tasty_\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Все началось четыре года назад, когда создала страницу в Instagram. Просто фотографировала то, что пекла и готовила, делилась рецептами. А когда поняла, что это многим нравится, еще больше втянулась в процесс.

Для салата с авокадо и филе курицы вам понадобятся (на две порции): 150 г микса салатных листьев, 100 г куриного филе, 60 г редиса, половинка авокадо, 10 перепелиных яиц, 1−2 ст. л. кедровых орешков, 1 ст. л. нерафинированного оливкового масла, ароматизированная соль, свежемолотый черный перец по вкусу. Яйца отварить, очистить, разрезать пополам. Редис помыть, очистить и тонко нарезать. Авокадо очистить и нарезать на тонкие дольки или кусочки. Салатные листья помыть и высушить. Куриное мясо мелко нарезать. Все ингредиенты смешать или выложить на тарелку слоями, полить оливковым маслом, добавить соль и перец по вкусу. Вместо оливкового масла можно использовать заправку из греческого (или натурального) йогурта, лимона, горчицы и специй.\n\nПроголосовать за Эмму вы можете на последней странице!\n\nОлег Ильин\n\nФото:\nличный архив Олега Ильина\n\nАккаунт: @oleg_ilyin\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Вдохновляюсь до сих пор. Честно говоря, я вообще не знал поначалу – кем хочу быть. Было много вариантов идей, задумок. Поступил после окончания школы в автомобилестроительный институт, по настоянию родителей. Слава богу, уже через 6 месяцев обучения там понял, что данное направление – ну вот совсем не мое, мягко говоря. Однажды купил справочник вузов и методом исключения стал выбирать – куда пойти учиться. Вот так и выбрал любимое дело: наткнувшись на перечисление кулинарных образовательных учреждений, подумал – оно! Сначала даже не о профессии кондитера подумал – а о поваре. Просто кондитер в моем представлении на тот момент – это такая добротная тетушка в засаленном халате, с колпаком на голове, которая пухлыми ручками месит тесто для пирогов. Но кулинария действительно с детства меня привлекала: в шесть лет я уже самостоятельно готовил завтрак для мамы! В общем так я попал в колледж работников гостиниц и ресторанов. С удовольствием доучился, очень быстро начал работать, набивать руку, практиковаться. И мне нравилось это все. И если ты получаешь удовлетворение и удовольствие от того, чем занимаешься – у тебя попросту нет иного пути, кроме того, как добиться чего-то стоящего в своей профессии. Короче, попал в «кондитерку» случайно – и это стало навсегда делом моей жизни, в котором не устаю развиваться и расти. Теперь я шеф-кондитер, владелец двух десертных ресторанов «Кондитерская Олега Ильина».\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Мне нравится почти все. Есть буквально несколько продуктов, которые я пока что не принял для себя (и то потому, что еще не подобрал правильный способ приготовления!): тот же булгур, допустим. Или, скажем, хумус. Как-то вот мы пока с ним не подружились. Кухни люблю все практически: в каждой обязательно найдётся для меня что-то свое, вкусное, удивительное: кухни разные стран имеют разные темпераменты и характеры. Нельзя сказать, что какая-то хуже или лучше. Просто надо узнавать поближе. Ближе всего мне русская (так называемая) кухня: богаче, наверное, сложно придумать. Мне кажется, каждый народ (а в России их великое множество) имеет свои «фирменные» блюда, заимствуя рецепты и кулинарные хитрости у соседей, передавая из поколения в поколение. Одной только каши (которую на Руси если и как самостоятельное блюдо и как гарнир к рыбе и мясу) – более ста рецептов. Выбирай на вкус. Винегрет – самый что ни на есть русский салат. Окрошка на квасе, ботвинья, рассольник, щи, уха – долго перечислять можно. Люблю нашу кухню за ее разнообразие и за то, что не нужно искать каких-то экзотических продуктов: все можно найти на собственном огороде при желании. Питаю так же слабость к кавказской кухне. Хотя понятие это условное – тут и грузинские блюда, и армянские, и азербайджанские… Но! Мясо, овощи, зелень, специи и красное вино – вот что их объединяет. И это изумительное сочетание.\n\n— Манты люблю. Узбекский плов. И высокую французскую кухню тоже. Короче говоря, когда бываю в новых странах – немедленно стараюсь познакомиться с гастрономическими особенностями. Начинаю «обход» с самых дешевых забегаловок (нередко там встречаются поистине фантастические традиционные блюда, приготовленные без прикрас, но с удивительным мастерством) и заканчиваю именитыми ресторанами (если есть поблизости мишленовские – обязательно иду туда). Кухня и кулинария (и кондитерка, естественно!) мне интересны с самых разных сторон. Скажу вам так: вкусно – не значит дорого. Одно из самых незабываемых мест, одно из самых «вкусных» мест, о котором я буду помнить всю жизнь – это столовая для рабочих рядом с овощным рынком у нас за МКАД. Меня однажды туда случайно занесло. Человек я смелый и охоч до экспериментов: пластиковыми столами и прожженными скатертями меня не возьмешь так просто! Захотелось посмотреть, попробовать. И это было здорово. Гастрономический оргазм какой-то. И вспоминаю с нежностью ресторан Анн-Софи Пик – единственной во Франции женщины-шеф-повара, получившей в гиде мишлен три звезды. В столовке обед обошелся мне в 400 рублей. В мишеленовском ресторане – в 800 евро. Поэтому могу с уверенностью заявить, что оцениваю кухню не по стоимости. Исключительно – по талантам.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\nВместе со своей дочерью Варей мы придумали нереально вкусное и простое в приготовлении блюдо – «Замешайка». Блюдо полезное, несложное и готовится из любых (практически!) продуктов, имеющихся в холодильнике. Вам нужно какое-нибудь мясо (куртка, индейка – идеально) или рыба. Рубите по-сельски так, от души, порционно, кладете в миску. После этого берете любые овощи, которые, на ваш взгляд, гармонично сочетаются с выбранным мясом (рыбой), тоже режете или рубите (как удобно) покрупнее – и туда же, в миску. Сбрызгиваете оливковым маслом, солите и перчите по вкусу, выкладываете все это в пакет для запекания – и час-полтора, при температуре 180−200 градусов все запекаете в духовке. Это нереально вкусно. Дети мои очень любят «Замешайку» и часто просят приготовить. Попробуйте – понравится, точно говорю!\n\nПроголосовать за Олега вы можете на последней странице!\n\nАнна Меркурова\n\nФото:\nличный архив Анны Меркуровой\n\nАккаунт: @annamerkurova\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— В детстве я наблюдала, как готовила мама, и мне очень хотелось быть такой же ловкой, быстро и просто творить вкусные блюда для семьи. А еще я была полненькой, дико любила сладкое, поэтому довольно быстро научилась печь сама, и, наверное, поэтому к выпечке у меня особенная тяга. Даже были мысли заняться этим направлением профессионально. Но в 2014 году я случайно прочитала интервью Любви Моисейкиной, которая организовывала масштабный фудфотоконкурс Chefs battle в Instagram, и решилась поучаствовать в очередном сезоне. С того момента я отдала часть своего сердца фудфотографии.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Имея огромную любовь к готовке, удивительно, но каких-то особенных предпочтений у меня нет. Мне нравятся простота основных ингредиентов с сочетанием оригинальной нотки, экспериментировать, добавляя то, что есть под рукой. Наверное, ближе всего итальянская и французская кухня – свежие овощи, ассорти сыров, вкусный хрустящий багет. Но самое любимое -это, конечно, блины по нашему семейному рецепту. Их предпочту взамен любому блюду! Нелюбимых продуктов как таковых нет. Я считаю, что на каждый «нелюбимый» ингредиент найдется тот, кто сделает из этого что-то фантастически вкусное. В этом и вся прелесть готовки.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Не изменяя себе это будет один из любимых пирогов нашей семьи – пирог с брокколи. Вам нужны: 500 г слоеного теста, 400 г брокколи, 250−300 г мягкой соленой брынзы (или фетаксы, или сиртаки), 300 г твердого сыра, 1 ч. л. молотой смеси итальянских или французских трав – тимьян, базилик, эстрагон, чабер, 1 яйцо, 0,5 ч. л. сахара. Тесто предварительно разморозить по инструкции. Духовку разогреть до 180 градусов. Прямоугольную форму для выпечки смазать небольшим количеством сливочного масла, подпылить мукой, на дно выложить лист пекарской бумаги. Если вы используете замороженную брокколи, предварительно размораживать ее не нужно; если вы используете свежий кочан – необходимо его промыть, разделить на соцветия. (ножку использовать по желанию, ее следует нарезать мелкими кубиками). Большой сотейник наполнить водой, довести до кипения, добавить брокколи, варить около 7−10 минут до средней мягкости. Далее воду слить, брокколи остудить. Крупные соцветия разрезать пополам. Мягкую брынзу нарезать кубиками, сыр натереть на крупной терке. Рабочую поверхность и скалку подпылить мукой. Поочередно раскатать два пласта теста в прямоугольник чуть больше размера вашей формы, нижний слой должен быть чуть толще, чем верхний. Выложить в подготовленную форму первый слой теста, сформировать небольшой бортик с каждой стороны высотой 1−1,5 см, всю поверхность теста наколоть вилкой. Далее слоями выложить брынзу, сверху брокколи, посыпать травами, добавить тертый сыр. Накрыть пирог вторым слоем теста, края защипнуть косичкой. Яйцо разбить в стакан, добавить сахар, взбить вилкой. Смазать кисточкой всю поверхность пирога яичной смесью. Выпекать пирог около 25−30 минут до золотистого цвета в зависимости от мощности вашей духовки. Готовый пирог достать из духовки, дать полностью остыть, нарезать порционно.\n\nПроголосовать за Анну вы можете на последней странице!\n\nАся Воскресенская\n\nФото:\nличный архив Аси Воскресенской\n\nАккаунт: @sunday_woman\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Еда не оставляет равнодушным ни одного человека, а приготовление еды – настоящее искусство. Я больше всего люблю готовить выпечку и десерты. Меня вдохновляет и каждый раз поражает магия процесса. Как жидкий белок превращается в хрустящую меренгу, как густеют сливки, превращаясь в крем, как растет дрожжевое тесто. А фотография – это моя вторая давняя страсть. Так два хобби (приготовление еды и фотография) соединились воедино и нашли воплощение в моем блоге в Instagram.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Я люблю пробовать новое. Люблю интересные необычные сочетания вкусов и текстур. Мне очень нравится провансальская кухня и средиземноморская с обилием всевозможных морепродуктов. А из десертов больше всего люблю цветочные, со вкусом розы, лаванды, фиалки и, кончено, шоколадные.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Самое простое, быстрое и вариативное блюдо – это паста. Вкусную пасту можно приготовить практически из чего угодно. Например, для пасты с морепродуктами я всегда держу в морозилке креветки или морской коктейль. Рецепт очень прост! И для него вам нужны: 150 гр любимой пасты, 100 гр креветок, 70 мл 10−20% сливок, 1 ч. л. сливочного масла, 2 зубчика чеснока, сок 1/3 лайма, несколько веточек петрушки, соль и черный перец по вкусу. Чеснок крупно прорезать и обжарить на сливочном масле с добавлением сока лайма. Убрать чеснок и добавить очищенные креветки. Обжаривать, помешивая, около 3 минут. Затем влить сливки, посолить и поперчить по вкусу, довести до кипения, добавить петрушку, перемешать и снять с огня. Пасту отварить согласно инструкции и смешать с соусом с креветками.

Нигде не училась и не снимаю для стоков или ресторанов. Фудфото – это одно из направлений моего основного увлечения, разработки рецептов. Пять лет назад, когда у меня был маленький ребенок на руках и несколько часов свободного времени в сутках, я искала чем заняться. Решила побольше готовить и разнообразить семейное меню. Искала в интернете рецепты, готовила… и в 9 случаях из 10 выкидывала еду. Потому что рецепты написаны так, что повторить их очень сложно, а зачастую сайты просто копируют друг у друга материал: текст от одного рецепта, фото – от другого. Хочешь сделать хорошо – сделай сам. Так появился мой кулинарный портал Nehudeem.ru, где каждый ингредиент имеет точный вес и рецепт сопровождается пошаговыми фотографиями.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Можно сказать, что я всеядная. Люблю азиатскую кухню, грузинскую, русскую. Есть продукты, которые я не приемлю в еде – это сырые яйца и субпродукты.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Я знаю, что многие хотят расширить свой рацион рыбными блюдами, но попросту не знают, как рыбу лучше приготовить. Поэтому предлагаю вам отличный рецепт рыбы в кляре, который подойдет как взрослым, так и малышам. Готовится блюдо всего 30 минут. Получается мягким, нежным и очень вкусным. На четыре порции вам понадобится: 700 г филе минтая, 2 ст. л. растительного масла, а для кляра – 2 яйца, 150 г пшеничной муки, 190 мл молока, 1/3 ч.л. соли, для посыпки – 80 г пшеничной муки. Подавать взрослым эти «рыбные палочки» рекомендую с упрощенным вариантом белого соуса тартар – 100 г маринованных огурцов, 2 зубчика чеснока, 15 гр укропа, 200 гр майонеза или сметаны. Зелень помыть. Включить духовку разогреваться до 180 градусов. В рецепте использовалось филе минтая, можно также готовить из судака, трески и другой белой рыбы, которая хорошо держит форму и не распадается при термической обработке. С филе белой рыбы аккуратно снять кожу острым ножом, вынуть пинцетом крупные кости. Филе нарезать брусочками толщиной 2 см. В тарелку насыпать муку для обвалки рыбы, остальная мука пойдет для приготовления кляра. Приготовить кляр: в миску разбить яйца, добавить молоко, оставшуюся муку, соль. Взбить вилкой до однородного состояния. Должна получиться консистенция густого кефира, тесто непрерывной струйкой стекает с ложки. В сковороду налить масло и поставить на средний огонь. Кусочки рыбы обвалять в муке, полностью окунуть в кляр и выкладывать на сковородку на расстоянии друг от друга. Готовить по 2−3 минуты с каждой стороны до легкого румяного цвета. Снять со сковородки ручку или переложить рыбу в форму для запекания в один слой и готовить в середине разогретой духовки 7−10 минут, в зависимости от размера рыбы. Важно не пересушить ее. Приготовить соус: чеснок почистить, вместе с солеными огурцами натереть на мелкую терку. Укроп помыть и мелко нарезать, соединить с огурцами. Выложить все в миску, добавить майонез. Размешать. Рыба в кляре готова. Рекомендуем подавать с соусом тартар, свежими овощам и гарниром: отварным рисом, картофелем.

Зубчики чеснока очистить. Томаты черри и чеснок выложить на противень, застеленный пергаментом. Полить оливковым маслом, положить веточки тимьяна. Запекать в разогретой до 200 градусов духовке около 20 минут. Спагетти сварить по инструкции на упаковке. Сыр потереть на мелкой терке, базилик мелко порубить. У готовых черри удалить кожицу. Томаты разрезать пополам или на четыре части. Печеный чеснок мелко порубить. Спагетти смешать с томатами, чесноком и оливковым маслом, с которым они запекались.

Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Я люблю готовить блюда самых разных кухонь! Обожаю делать пасту болоньезе с пармезаном, марроканскую шакшуку и хумус, американские черничные панкейки с кленовым сиропом. Сейчас мой фаворит – тайская кухня и пад тай с креветками. Первый раз попробовала его в Америке и настолько была поражена сочетанием острого кисло-сладкого соуса с рисовой лапшой и жареным арахисом, что теперь готовлю его почти каждую неделю. Планируем сделать с ним съемку.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Пад тай с креветками. Готовится буквально минут 15, нужно только заранее замочить лапшу. Ингредиенты на 2−3 порции: рисовая лапша (не фунчоза, а плоская) – 300 г, овощи: болгарский перец, бобовые ростки, китайская капуста, лук, чеснок. По объему примерно столько же, сколько и лапши, затем – соус пад тай, 100 г креветок, жареный арахис, лайм. Лапшу приготовить по инструкции на упаковке, они бывают разные, но в основном ее нужно либо отварить несколько минут в кипящей воде, либо замочить на 30 минут, откинуть на дуршлаг, промыть холодной водой и немного просушить. Я оставляю ее стекать в дуршлаге, пока не понадобится. Креветки почистить и замариновать в соусе пад тай минут на 10. Лук и чеснок поджарить до золотистого цвета. Овощи мелко нашинковать, добавить к луку, готовить на средне-сильном огне, чтобы они поджарились, но сохранили упругость. Лучше это делать на вок-сковороде, но можно и на обычной. Добавить креветки и жарить еще 2 минуты до их готовности. Снять с огня и отложить. Лапшу обжарить пару минут на кунжутном масле и еще пару минут в соусе пад тай. Она должна стать эластичной. Добавить в лапшу овощи с креветками, все как следует перемешать. Разложить лапшу по тарелкам, посыпать сверху толченым арахисом (я размалываю его очень мелко, практически в муку, чтобы он лучше прилипал к лапше), положить по дольке лайма. По вкусу можно поливать соевым, устричным или рыбным соусом.\n\nПроголосовать за Дарью вы можете на последней странице!\n\nОля Малышева\n\nФото:\nличный архив Оли Малышевой\n\nАккаунт: @salatshop\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Я начала интересоваться и активно погружаться в тему здорового питания еще 13 лет назад. Тогда вегетарианство и ЗОЖ не были таким трендом, как сегодня. Киноа, зеленые смузи, овощные соки, десерты без сахара и муки – тогда все это было большой редкостью в России. Здоровое питание часто ассоциировалось с жесткими диетами, безвкусными овощными салатами и постоянным подсчетом калорий. Мне хотелось показать, что здоровое питание может быть очень вкусным, красивым и при этом простым в приготовлении. В своем блоге Salatshop я стала рассказывать о своем опыте, любимых книгах, специалистах и вегетарианских рецептах без сахара и муки.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Стараюсь, чтобы в еде было много овощей, цельные крупы, разнообразие вкусов, ингредиентов и текстур и минимум сложностей. Вместо пшеничной муки использую полбяную и кукурузную. Вместо белого сахара добавляю в десерты финики, сироп топинамбура или кокосовый сахар. Люблю итальянскую и грузинскую кухню. В целом мне понравится любая кухня, где не скупятся на овощи и любят цельные продукты. Обожаю специи, а также элементы тайской кухни – например, часто использую на своей кухне кокосовое молоко и слегка острыми специями. Еще я большой адепт смузи и свежевыжатых соков – если знать правильные сочетания и пропорции, эти напитки могут быть невероятно вкусными и очень полезными.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Рецепт тыквенного супа с кремом из кешью. Обожаю его за нежный сливочный вкус и простоту приготовления. Вам потребуются: ½ небольшой тыквы, 2 средних морковки, 1 л воды, 1 луковица, 1 ч. л. куркумы, 2 ложки оливкового масла, ½ лимона, 150 г нежареных кешью (замоченных на 2−3 часа), соль и перец по вкусу. Нарезанную тыкву и морковь и отправьте в кастрюлю и залейте 1 л воды. Доведя до кипения, убавьте огонь, добавьте нарезанный лук и варите до мягкости. Пока варится суп, приготовьте крем из кешью. Промойте заранее замоченные кешью и смешайте их в блендере с 1—1,5 стаканами питьевой воды и солью. Когда овощи в супе станут мягкими, добавьте куркуму и выключите огонь. Добавьте сок лимона, оливковое масло, соль и перец по вкусу. Влейте крем из кешью и смешайте суп блендером до однородной текстуры.

На еду смотрю скорее как на объект для съемки, чем как на лакомство. Но в чем никогда не могу себе отказать, так это в фастфуде!\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Гамбургеры со свекольным кетчупом. На два 2 гамбургера вам понадобится: для свекольного кетчупа – 1 средняя свекла (весом примерно 150 г) – отварить и остудить, 2,5 ч.л. бальзамического уксуса, 2 ст.л. оливкового масла, 1−2 ч. л. меда, соль, перец по вкусу, 2 булочки для гамбургеров (разрезать вдоль), 3−4 ст. л. оливкового масла для обжаривания, 150 г вешенок, 300 г говяжьего фарша, 2 яйца, 1 маленькая красная луковица (нарезать тонкими кольцами), 20 г зелени кольраби-кресс. Приготовить кетчуп из свеклы: свеклу измельчить в блендере до состояния пюре, добавить бальзамический уксус, оливковое масло, мед, соль и перец, тщательно перемешать. Булочки обжарить с внутренней стороны на раскаленной сковороде без масла, в течении нескольких минут, до образования золотистой корочки. Вешенки разделить на небольшие соцветия и обжарить на оливковом масле с двух сторон, слегка придавливая сверху, до образования корочки. Посолить, поперчить. Из говяжьего фарша сформировать две котлеты по размеру булочек. Обжарить на оливковом масле до необходимой степени прожарки. Яйца пожарить в виде глазуньи. Собрать гамбургеры.\n\nПроголосовать за Яну вы можете на последней странице!\n\nАлла Ершова\n\nФото:\nличный архив Аллы Ершовой\n\nАккаунт: @baking_maniac\n\nЧто вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?\n\n— Еда – мой фетиш и один из главных источников удовольствия. Несколько лет назад попробовав приготовить дома некоторые мои любимые десерты, поняла, что получаются они аппетитнее тех, что я когда-либо ела в кафе и ресторанах. Желание отменно поесть у меня всегда было сильнее лени, поэтому я стала готовить все чаще и чаще, пристрастила к десертам членов своей семьи, друзей, а потом просто не смогла остановиться. Сейчас я даже не знаю, что доставляет мне большее наслаждение – вкусная еда или ее приготовление.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может наоборот, есть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?\n\n— Обожаю итальянскую кухню во всем многообразии ее региональных вариаций! Многие «гурманы» считают ее слишком простой, но мне кажется, именно в этом и заключается вся прелесть. Привлекает особенное отношение к еде в Италии – с искренней любовью и уважением. Семейные рецепты бережно хранятся и передаются из поколения в поколение. Блюда готовятся преимущественно из натуральных сезонных продуктов – из того, что есть дома в настоящий момент. В процессе приготовления продукты не теряют своих вкусовых качеств, а, напротив, зачастую раскрывают их в выгодном свете. Ну и, конечно, культура неспешной трапезы – вот, где истинный slow food! Как кондитер не могу не упомянуть о любимых десертах – это сицилийские трубочки канолли и меренговый десерт «Павлова» (вовсе не итальянский, но обожаемый всей душой). Могу есть их каждый день на завтрак, обед и ужин!\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Сейчас я готовлюсь к отпуску, поэтому поделюсь классным рецептом простого в приготовлении и легкого салата с киноа и молодым горошком. На две порции вам нужно: 85 г киноа, 100 г феты или брынзы, 25 стручков горошка, 50 г рукколы, 2 яйца, оливковое масло, сок 1 лимона, соль и перец по вкусу. Залить киноа холодной водой и оставить на 15 минут. Слить воду. Переложить крупу в сотейник и залить водой (воды должно быть в 2 раза больше по объёму, чем крупы). Довести до кипения, уменьшить огонь и продолжать варить до готовности примерно 15 минут (воды не должно остаться, а крупа быть рассыпчатой). В конце варки добавьте соль (по желанию). Отварить яйцо всмятку, залить холодной водой и оставить на 5−7 минут. Очистить от скорлупы. Для приготовления заправки смешать оливковое масло, сок лимона, соль и перец, хорошенько взбить. В тарелку выложить руколу, охлажденное киноа, порезанную кубиками брынзу или фету и зеленый горошек, слегка перемешать. Перед подачей заправить салат.

Люблю блюда русской и итальянской кухонь.\n\nЭксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.\n\n— Мой рецепт палочка-выручалочка для быстрого и вкусного семейного ужина – сочное куриное филе за 20 минут. Для его приготовления понадобится: куриное филе – 2 шт. по 250−300 г, панировочные сухари 20 г, масло растительное 20 мл, соль 0,5 ч. л., масло сливочное 40 г. Приготовление: разогреть духовку до 230−250 градусов вместе с огнеупорной формой для запекания. Куриное филе помыть, обсушить, нарезать на порционные куски (одно филе – 4−5 кусков). Запанировать каждый кусочек куриного филе в сухарях. Аккуратно достать огнеупорную форму, добавить растительное масло, насыпать половину соли и выложить куриное филе, посолить кусочки сверху, поставить в духовку на 10 минут. По прошествии 10 минут достать форму, перевернуть кусочки филе, положить на каждый по пластинке сливочного масла и вернуть в духовку еще на 10 минут. Готовое филе сервировать на тарелки, дать отдохнуть в течение 5 минут и можно подавать.

Так как кормила дочку грудью, искала варианты полезной и в тоже время вкусной еды, скорее не еды, а десертов, потому что сладкоежка! Хочу отметить, что от сахара и от мусорной еды я отказалась еще задолго до беременности. Еда моя была чистой воды правильным питанием (ПП). Курогрудка, греча, контейнеры на работу и типа того. Из десертов всякие вариации обезжиренного творога со стевией. Потом забеременела. Первый триместр меня жутко тошнило. Здесь я ПП забросила, потому что надо было есть хоть что-то. Нет, я не стала есть только фастфуд и все такое, просто позволяла себе больше вкусняшек, но в меру. За всю беременность набрала кг 10. В планах вернуться к ПП было сразу после родов, так как кормить собиралась грудью. Но не тут то было! К той пэпэшной еде возвращаться совсем не хотелось, хотелось чего-то другого! Ну и наткнулась в ИГ на смузи и там пошло поехало. Сначала это были просто смузи, потом смузибоулы, сыроедческие торты, конфеты. Первое время просто любовалась зарубежными картинками со смузи, готовила сама и съедала. Потом решила создать свою страничку уже со своими фотками и рецептами.\n\nКакую кухню любите сами?

Вам понадобится: ½ стакана киноа, 1 стакан воды, 1 стакан микрозелени (или шпината), ½ авокадо, 10 шт. помидор черри, 1 ст. л. оливкового масла, 1 ч л лимонного сока, соль по вкусу. Варим киноа в соотношение 1 к 2 (крупа/вода) 15 минут. Режем помидоры на половинки, авокадо кубиками. Зелень моем.

        "articleBody": "2020 Audi e-tron Sportback revealed as electric 4-door coupe - SlashGear\n\nEXPLORE\nTech\nCars\nGaming\nEntertainment\nScience\nFEATURES\nReviews\nColumns\n\nTech\nCars\nGaming\nEntertainment\nScience\nFeatures\n\nReviews\nColumns\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\nRSS\nSearch SlashGear\nSearch\n\n2020 Audi e-tron Sportback revealed as electric 4-door coupe\n\nChris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 8:15 pm CST\n0\n\nAudi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric range, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto Show. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\n\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\n\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road – such as markings – with extra-precision.\n\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\n\nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\n\nPower and Performance\n\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\n\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with seven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\n\nRange and Charging\n\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge – which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a new “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\n\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.\n\nStory Timeline\n\nAudi e-tron GT Concept First Drive: Welcome to the future\n2019 Audi e-tron Review: Grading on a Curve\n\n2020 Audi e-tron Sportback Gallery\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\n\nTopics Audi EV LA Auto Show 2019 luxury\nMust Read Bits & Bytes\n\nGoogle Play Store needs more than AI to make app recommendations useful\n\n2020 Audi e-tron Sportback revealed as electric 4-door coupe\n\nPokemon Sword and Shield first impressions: My kingdom for a Bulbasaur\n\nPokemon GO creators’ next big game: CATAN World Explorers\n\nSony bets on artificial intelligence with new Sony AI global division\n\nSite Information\n\nAbout / Advertise / Tip Us / Contact\n\nPolicies\n\nEditorial Standards / Ethics Statement / Privacy Policy / Terms of Use\n© 2005-2019 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.\n\nSocial and Media\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nRSS Feed"

In fact, Nissan still believes in sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\n\nAfter debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers off the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is paired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been redesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\n\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the U.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the all-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality, technology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic design cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,” said David Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at Nissan North America Inc.\n\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front grill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also has a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier design. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated finish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke alloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\n\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality materials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are all wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up the overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and front passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come with a heated function.\n\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It also doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows for safer parking / maneuvering.\n\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of torque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared to the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new 2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\n\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra. These include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision warning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\n\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January.

Hours later, she woke up as a different person — and became a great songwriter.\n\nDavid Ehrlich\n\nNov 13, 2019 4:26 pm\n\n@davidehrlich\n\nShare This Article\nReddit\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nPrint\nTalk\n\n“Wild Rose”\n\nThe bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-write the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of “ Wild Rose ” — easily the year’s best original movie song — began 10 years ago, when the “Melvin and Howard” star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling like her mind was on fire.\n\n“I felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,” Steenburgen said. “The best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was only music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my thoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldn’t get my mind into any other mode.”\n\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way — the late neurologist wrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book “Musicophilia” — Steenburgen wasn’t thrilled about the sudden mental shift. The next two months were tough. “I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t have acted,” she said. “I couldn’t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I were kind of frightened about it.”\n\nRelated\n\n'And Then We Danced' Returns Queer Film to Political Relevance With Global Impact\n'Waves': Why Taylor Russell Is One of Oscar Season's Biggest Revelations\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Watch and Livestream This Week's Impeachment Hearings\nGolden Globes 2020 Predictions: Best Actor and Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie\n\nSteenburgen’s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (“The Discovery,” “The One I Love”), also remembers it as a trying time. “If your mom comes to you after surgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think it’s totally fair to think that she’s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,” he said. “All of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up random instruments — I’m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me nuts,” McDowell laughed. “When I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was definitely a change.”\n\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn’t exactly itching to do something else. “I had been somebody who really liked music,” she said, “but I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with acting, and that felt like a big enough subject for me.”\n\nWhen the music didn’t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do something with it — if only for her sanity — even though she didn’t know how to play an instrument. “I called a very talented friend of mine on Martha’s Vineyard and I said: ‘Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in my head, could you help me make them into songs?’” she said. She wrote hundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer under her mother’s name. “He wanted to work with ‘Nellie Wall,’ but then I showed up instead,” she said.\n\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a songwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a strange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley’s doorstep almost a decade later.\n\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper — a young British filmmaker hot off directing a lush BBC adaptation of “War & Peace” — had just found his next project. He’d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called “Wild Rose,” a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian country singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline ballads at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley — who landed a key role in “War & Peace” after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition “I’d Do Anything” — had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones that she was perfect for the part.\n\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie together didn’t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that Rose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she’s learned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both feel a little more special, but no details. Phoning in from London, Harper remembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece: “The script just said something along the lines of, ‘Rose-Lynn sings an incredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom and kids and everyone’s uplifted. The end,’” Harper said. “I had faith that we could figure it out, but it was really worrying.” Universal’s music division provided some demos, but none of them clicked.\n\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called “Glasgow (“No Place Like Home”). “It grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,” he said. “It just connected.” Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of “Fargo,” had a similar experience: “It was just that immediate feeling of ‘ this is the song.’”\n\nThat’s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found themselves blindsided by “the Mary Steenburgen of it all.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her own dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her fame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than Rose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. “It was terrifying,” she said. “The first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my hotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought ‘Why would anyone be so stupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?’”\n\nBut she also felt like she didn’t have much of a choice. “I was back at it by the next morning,” she said. “I just told myself: ‘I’m going to go right up and sing the bleeping song if it kills me!’” Not long after that, Steenburgen bought a house in Nashville.\n\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to scat in the backseat of his car. “It could have been really easy for Mary Steenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the usual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn’t do that,” she said. “She put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to admit, she’s gotten really good at the accordion.”\n\nSteenburgen’s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the competition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for “Wild Rose” were content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there, Steenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her to play. “I fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was looking at such a small part of the story without it,” she said. “Where does Rose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of imagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the cinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people you haven’t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the whole thing, I understood what we were writing.”\n\nThat process led to a realization: “It was a really love song from Rose-Lynn to her mother …It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the concept of home and the fact that home doesn’t have to be second best for her or something that she settles for.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the television show “Nashville,” Steenburgen’s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate York came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of writing character-driven chords. “It’s a totally different muscle,” York said. “You have to take yourself out of it a little bit — it’s kind of like acting, I guess.” Smith agreed: “It’s a different job altogether. If you’re just writing a song for someone else, it’s wide open and sometimes hard to figure out. And if you’re writing for yourself, you’re really digging into your own heart.” This particular task was a little bit of both. “I feel like we could get into the guts of this song because we’ve all lived a similar crazy dream story,” Smith said.\n\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so the three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA (not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on something with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the songwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn’s life, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\n\n“Anything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,” Steenburgen said. “So I called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny and ended up like a sister,” a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot of the film. “So I called her up and said ‘Talk to me in your accent — talk to me about you.’ And through that we wound up with images like the opening line: ‘I’ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.’”\n\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours — which, when you listen to “Glasgow,” seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen to co-write it. “It may sound shallow or like it’s a factory when I talk about how fast we write these things,” Steenburgen said, “but I always think of it like this: ‘I can’t take days to do a scene.’ I can’t say ‘I don’t know what the emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?’ I’m always having to tell stories on a time limit.” Steenburgen has only found one drawback to collaborating with Smith and York: “They’re such good singers that people are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, ‘Well I can’t sing like that, so I’m not doing that song.’”\n\n“Wild Rose”\n\n1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\n\nBuckley, who hadn’t sung in a long time before the production, worried about doing justice to a song like “Glasgow,” especially given that she had no background in country music. “But the story of it really moved me,” she said, “so I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just tried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.”\n\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-surprised: “It made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex understanding of character — someone who was able to kind of go right to the root of what this woman’s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that exposed the cracks under the surface,” she said.\n\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew a distinction with her character. “I told her my secrets and she told me hers and we built a different person together,” she said. “‘Glasgow’ is a song of belonging. It’s about stretching yourself to places that you don’t know are within yourself.” For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to sing about. “This song was such a gift to me,” she said. In turn, it also became her gift to the women who wrote it.\n\nSteenburgen called Buckley’s performance “stunning,” but seemed changed by the experience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved. “Music is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was somehow granted access to it,” she said. “It was so overwhelming for me in the beginning because I didn’t grow up with having that voice in my head, like Kate and Caitlyn did.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film’s last scene conveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It begins with Buckley’s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn summons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She apologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to escape: “I pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.”\n\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the first ray of sunshine after a squall: It’s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn’s way towards a place she never could have imagined before. “Had to find my own way, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,” she sings. “Ain’t no yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that’s stronger than stone.”\n\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who’s tunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley’s voice swells from low to high and back again. She sings on behalf of anyone who’s ever had to learn about themselves the hard way: “Ain’t no place like home,” she and Rose-Lynn sing together, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along with all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the 12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It’s staggering.\n\nIt’s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet, happiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When Steenburgen’s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird quirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she’d had since she was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new reality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her now, it sounds like she’s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\n\n“I didn’t fall out of love with acting when this happened,” Steenburgen said, “and I still haven’t. But there’s so much more capability in our brains than we probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a choice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don’t really have to do that.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n“Wild Rose” is now available on DVD and VOD.\n\nPopular on IndieWire\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

We’re on it.’ They just might be.\n\nUpdated Nov 19, 9:41 AM; Posted Nov 18, 8:19 PM\n\nAlex Wong | Getty Images\n\nKristi Noem, governor of South Dakota, pictured at the White House turkey pardon in 2018, when she was a congresswoman. Her new anti-meth campaign is raising eyebrows.\n\nBy Amy Kuperinsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\n\nRemember New Jersey’s epic quest to find a state slogan?\n\n(We never did settle on one, unlike our 565 municipalities, which are packed with them.)\n\nEnter South Dakota to throw down the gauntlet. The state’s new slogan for an anti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social media Monday.\n\nJust what is this priceless slogan?\n\n“Meth. We’re on it.”\n\nYes, that’s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know that her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. On it!\n\nOf course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that Florida Man will have to up the ante next time.\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on Twitter pointed it out.\n\nYes this is real and yes the state spent nearly half a million dollars on it: https://t.co/Nc0nKoXGBP\n\n— Dianna E. Anderson 🏳️‍🌈 (@diannaeanderson) November 18, 2019\n\nSo many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state and “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends.\n\nAccording to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem launched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth crisis.\n\n“Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which people say, “I’m on meth.”\n\nThe report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the campaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.\n\nOh, no. It seems like the rest of South Dakota's anti-drug campaigns are just as bad as the \"Meth. We're On It.\" campaign. pic.twitter.com/3BDnrvkoms\n\n— Mike Beauvais (@MikeBeauvais) November 18, 2019\n\non. meth. dot. com.\nmeth.\nwe’re. on. it. https://t.co/HO1ZRs9T1P\n\n— tall glass of coquito 🎄 (@_orabora) November 19, 2019\n\nNoem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan.\n\n“Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,” Noem tweeted. “So I think that’s working.”\n\nShe proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website for the initiative, which contains the following statement:\n\n“South Dakota has a problem. There isn’t a single solution because meth is widespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take over counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.”\n\nHey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness. So I think that’s working... #thanks #MethWeAreOnIt\n⬇️⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/hopPjqa95w\n\n— Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) November 18, 2019\n\nStill, this isn’t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota.\n\nConsider this 2014 entry — “ Don’t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers from jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads.\n\nThe road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew enough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety.\n\nWhile we focus on South Dakota’s “Meth. We’re on it.” ad campaign, we should not forget the state’s failed “Don’t Jerk and Drive” campaign from 2014. https://t.co/hFciHO5Qc7 pic.twitter.com/KQLpngeTbO\n\n— Cooper Lund (@cooperlund) November 18, 2019\n\nHave a tip?

Please see my disclosure page.\nHolidays Recipes\n\nHomemade Spiced Honey Pear Jam for the Holidays\n\nby Regan December 6, 2017\nwritten by Regan\n\nSharing is caring!\n\n858 shares\n\nPinterest\nFacebook\nTwitter\nMix\nFlipboard\nReddit\n\nThis holiday season I was thinking of flavors that would put me in the holiday spirit when it came to me. Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear jam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove, this honey pear jam recipe will have you spreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It’s so easy and delicious that you’ll want to make some extra for yourself!\n\nIs there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a dollop of jam? Especially homemade jam. Not many things are more homey and comforting than jam that has been made in someone’s kitchen. Up until not too long ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards. Jam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made, and then I tried it. Honestly, it’s so easy that anyone can do it with a few simple ingredients and not much equipment.\n\nRelated post: Pickled Brussels Sprouts Recipe\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAM\n\nDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don’t know. Help!\n\nThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a pressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water bath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain stockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They also come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from coming in contact with the bottom of the canner.\n\nIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce jelly jars), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water. You could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs made specifically to fit over mason jars.\n\nMAKING SPICED HONEY PEAR JAM\n\nNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe pears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and a 16-ounce Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar. Before getting your jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it to simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam.\n\nCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To the pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test it to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the fruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices and pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let the mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes.\n\nHOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\n\nWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the mixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been going a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend that, so please pour slowly and carefully.\n\nNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the canner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a time. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If you live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to adjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are at 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If your jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take 24-48 hours to really look like jam.\n\nGIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAM\n\nIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so many ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift basket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass them out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your gift, it’s sure to be a winner.\n\nDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece of fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a ribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you wish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers.\n\nUSING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\n\nI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when substituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount. For instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar, but I only use a cup and a half of honey.\n\nBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or homemade vanilla scones.\n\nSpiced Honey Pear Jam\n\nPrint\n\nIngredients\n\n8-9 ripe pears, cored and peeled\n1 lemon, or about 1/4 cup lemon juice\n6 tbsp fruit pectin powder\n1 tsp cinnamon\n1 tsp nutmeg\n1 tsp ground ginger\n1/2 tsp ground cloves\n1 jar Don Victor® Honey, or 1 1/2 cups\n\nInstructions\n\nFill canner with water and set it to simmer. Add empty jelly jars to sterilize and warm.\nCore, peel, and cube the pears and put them in a pot. Add the juice of one lemon, spices, and fruit pectin. Boil while stirring frequently for about a minute\nAdd 1 1/2 cups Don Victor® Honey and boil until thickened enough to stick to the spoon.\nSpoon jam mixture into jelly jars, put the top on, and put them in a water bath canner, increasing the heat to a easy boil.\nBoil for *10 minutes (if over 1000 feet, adjust for altitude)\nRemove from canner and allow to cool. Jam will set within 24-48 hours.\n\n© Regan\n\nYou may also like:\n\nSharing is caring!\n\n858 shares\n\nPinterest\nFacebook\nTwitter\nMix\nFlipboard\nReddit\n\nbreakfast canning easy recipes fruit vegetables jam sponsored\n2 comments\n1\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Email\n\nRegan\n\nRegan is a Southeastern Connecticut native now living in Central Massachusetts with her husband, two sons, and two cats.

However, it would have been helpful if you had included the amount of prepared fruit. I had to guess. My pears came from a friend’s tree and were all different sizes. I used approximately 7 cups of fruit, which I think could’ve been a little more than needed, but still turned out good. The recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of fruit pectin which is one tablespoon more than a box of Sure Jell. I had to open another box for 1 tablespoon. I really hated doing that. I will have to find something that uses less than a box. Someone who is new to jam making might have a bit of a problem with this recipe. It was worth the effort, but needs a little more information. The cook time after the honey is added should also be included in the recipe. Thanks for sharing it; I’m glad that I had an opportunity to try it.\n\nReply\nRegan August 19, 2019 - 5:48 pm\n\nHi Cherie,\n\nI’m glad you liked it and thanks for your feedback. I used a jar of pectin so the number of tablespoons I used was my personal preference for consistency, but if you are using a box then you could probably do with just the five tablespoons if the consistency is to your liking with that amount.\n\nReply\n\nLeave a Comment Cancel Reply\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\nNotify me via e-mail if anyone answers my comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Staying on the Moon and reaching Mars, however, haven’t. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\nIt is for that reason that the United States's space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry’s upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\n\nMore:\n\nThe New Space Race\n\nSpacewalking into 'her-story'\n\nChina completes landing test for its first Mars mission in 2020\n\n“We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\n\n“This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,” he said.\n\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed to that timeline.\n\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted “technical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays ”. The report and Monday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\n\nIn May, NASA’s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expand ed to Jupiter’s moon Europa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon’s icy crust.\n\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water - are on Europa.\n\nCloser to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been on last year’s original list.\n\n“We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting times. We’re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\n\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\n\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n“Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and Founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n“There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players.

Here’s what he had to say…\n\nQ: Junior – We are so excited to have you as our new President and CEO. When you woke up that first morning and you were officially in charge, what are two words to describe how it felt?\n\nA: Inspired and humbled! To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this particular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love Experience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has been a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the past six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that change has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to work as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry. Also, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and every day!\n\nQ: What’s the one thing you’ve learned in your past roles that is the most helpful as CEO?\n\nA: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a person is coming from is the biggest lesson I’ve learned. I would also add being comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You must be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a rapidly evolving market, you’re never going to always have 100 percent complete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that reality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\n\nQ: How do you prioritize your day?\n\nA: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits – “Put first things first”, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the top of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller items on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for emails so I’m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at hand.\n\nThe best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our outstanding 350 partners - you couldn’t ask for better of either. Our employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I’m honored to serve them every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry. Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things with us, which is priceless.\n\nQ: What’s on the horizon for the business?\n\nA: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to consumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a flat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a dedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section just for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the industry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new way to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to target fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we’ll be much more intelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the technology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience – we can’t wait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\n\nQ: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the most?\n\nA: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the business each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the number of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships regularly. This is something I knew intellectually coming into the role, but the need to balance the internal and external relationships with employees, clients, strategic partners, media, etc.. requires a clear plan and direct approach.\n\nQ: In reading the SportsBusiness Journal, it was noted that you’ve been named a 40 Under 40 Award recipient. Congratulations!!! What’s it like to be named a 40 Under 40?\n\nA: I am very honored to be on the SBJ 40 Under 40 list. It’s a very prestigious group of folks this year – and in years past – and I am so appreciative of the recognition. I thank my family and the wonderful people I work with for their encouragement and support. It really means a lot and I share this recognition with the entire Experience team.\n\nOk, now for a little fun.\n\nQ: Where did you grow up?\n\nA: St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands – the most beautiful 87 square miles in the world (I am biased) and home of five time NBA champion Tim Duncan.\n\nQ: Favorite childhood memory?\n\nA: Trip to Disney World\n\nQ: Favorite apps?\n\nA: Bleacher Report, Uber Eats, and ParkMobile\n\nQ: Favorite artists or groups?\n\nA: Bob Marley, Bruno Mars, Drake, The Eagles, Jay Z, Frank Sinatra\n\nQ: Favorite books?\n\nA: A Fistful of Rice and The Hard Thing About Hard Things\n\nQ: Favorite live event you’ve ever attended?\n\nA: Broncos vs. Raiders at Mile High Stadium in the Peyton Manning record breaking season. He threw five touchdowns and the crowd was absolutely rocking!\n\nQ: Favorite athlete?\n\nA: Lebron James\n\nQ: Favorite places you have visited?\n\nA: Tie between Istanbul, Turkey and Cape Town, South Africa\n\nQ: Most memorable live event experience?\n\nA: Watching from courtside as Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant scored 50 plus points a piece in a triple overtime game in their last season in Oklahoma City Thunder – AND, seeing Adele live in concert – she brought the house down!\n\nQ: What are your hobbies?\n\nA: Watching NBA League Pass, reading, travel, and spending time with my family.\n\nQ: Favorite technology purchase in the last 5 years\n\nA: Sonos – Music is the soundtrack to your life and the ability to fill your house with those sounds at the touch of a button is amazing. Also, they do it in an incredibly simple way.\n\nThanks Junior!\n\n« Previous Post Next Post »\n\nCategories:\n\nFan Testimonial\nHow To\nOpinions\nPartner Announcement\nPartner Success\nPress\nPro Tips\nResearch\nSolutions\nSpotlight\nUpdates\n\nOther pages\n\nExperience\n\nWho We Are\nOur Team\nWork With Us\nPress/Media Center\nPrivacy\nTerms\n\nSolutions\n\nMobile Commerce\nTicketing Technology\nData Solutions\n\nCommunity\n\nBlog\nEngineering Blog\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nInstagram\n\nOur mobile commerce, flexible ticket sales, and data solutions empower sports and entertainment leaders to generate new revenue streams, sell more tickets, and make smarter decisions.\n\nContact us 3535 Piedmont Rd NE #415 Atlanta, GA 30305\n© 2019 Experience"

Seating is good and we also had the chance to have a picture with the cast after the show.”\n\n– Ni** My**\n\n“It was a 75-minute long non-verbal play with the narrative texts shown occasionally on screen to explain what’s happening in case audiences fail to catch the meaning of their interpretative dance and performances. It showcased traditional drum performances of the ladies back in the days with mixes of modernized dance moves and music. The theater was fairly small so getting the cheapest tickets would still be ok. Actors occasionally come out from aisles as well… we got seats on the 3rd row, letting us clearly see the facial expressions of everyone stage. Overall, it was entertaining enough for its cost.”\n\n– Jo** Al****\n\n“A gorgeous play with an interesting storytelling style. The actors were very happy and interactive with the audience.

Wait, what?\n\nThe drama began earlier this year when Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big Machine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which already held a stake in Ithaca, is part of a growing number of PE shops getting involved in the music industry.\n\nWhy? Because, capitalism, of course. You see, owning music catalogs has become an incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks begin circling*\n\nBack to Taylor! It’s her music, so why can’t she sing it?\n\nIt’s complicated.\n\nAccording to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka original recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the American Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to their original recordings. What isn't as common is a label not allowing an artist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in Swift's case ... most of her music) benefits the owner and the artist financially.\n\nHe said, she said\n\nT-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The Carlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ... because hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has denied Swift’s claims, saying they were “shocking and false.” And Taylor Swift fans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\n\nThe bottom line ...\n\nTaylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she’ll be re-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher. Which versions play on the radio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to Big Machine and The Carlyle Group.\n\nMoving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music Group, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder: \"what did we do to deserve this?\"\n\nWhy Can’t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

        "articleBody": "Die elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) – der lange Marsch ins Digitale Gesundheitswesen\n\nZurück zur Übersicht\n\nVon Moritz Bachmann publiziert am 25. September 2018\n\nDie elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) – der lange Marsch ins Digitale Gesundheitswesen\n\nDie Digitalisierung als Wachstums- und Entwicklungstreiber zieht sich bereits heute durch fast alle Branchen und Anwendungsgebiete, sei es im Finanzbereich, der Industrie oder eben auch im Bereich Healthcare. Auch wenn nicht jedes Geschäftsmodell von Disruption bzw. Digital Darwinismus bedroht ist, bieten neue Technologien Potenziale für mehr Effizienz, bessere Prozesse und zur Kostenersparnis.\n\nIm Bereich der Gesundheitsversorgung in Krankenhäusern ist dieser Aspekt ein besonders wichtiger. Durch die Festlegung von Fallpauschalen und Sonderentgelten besteht ein hoher Kostendruck. Der Bedarf an mehr Effizienz durch Digitalisierung bleibt nicht nur wünschenswert, er ist zwingend notwendig. Damit das gelingt, ist der Einsatz von geeigneten interoperablen Lösungen entscheidend.\nDas Thema mit dem höchsten Potenzial aber auch mit den meisten Hindernissen wird seit Jahren intensiv diskutiert: Die elektronische Patientenakte (ePA)\n\nStatus Quo\n\nAnaloge Prozesse\n\nIn Deutschland liegen Patientendaten in internen Systemen vor – Sei es in Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) oder im Praxisverwaltungssystem (PVS) niedergelassener Ärzte. Auch die Dokumentation von weiteren Befunden ist in der Regel ein manueller Vorgang. Zwischen einzelnen Leistungserbringern werden Patienteninformationen, Befunde, Röntgenbilder teils digital, z.B. durch einrichtungsinterne Informationssysteme, aber auch analog in Form der Fieberkurve in der Behandlungskette weitergereicht. Handschriftliche Dokumentationen und postalischer Versand und Empfang sind fehleranfällig. Behandelnde Mediziner sind dabei nicht immer auf dem aktuellsten Stand, erhalten wichtige Patientendaten gar nicht oder zu spät und müssen Zeit für die Konsultation mit Kollegen aufwenden. Langwierige Behandlungszeiträume aber auch doppelt geführte oder unvollständige Patientenakten sind die Folge. Durch unnötige Überbehandlung und Dokumentation sowie Behandlungsfehler entstehen so jährlich Kosten in Milliardenhöhe.\n\nEinrichtungsübergreifende Intransparenzen\n\nAufgrund des medizinischen Fortschritts sind Behandlungszentren und Einrichtungen aber auch die einzelnen Berufsgruppen im Gesundheitswesen hochdifferenziert. Je nach Diagnose und Krankheitsbild werden Untersuchungen und Therapien für Patienten in arbeitsteiligen, teils parallel ablaufenden Prozessen und über mehrere Fachkliniken, Fachbereiche und Akteure abgebildet. Die so entstehenden Versorgungsketten sind zwischen den Einrichtungen nur lose bis gar nicht verzahnt, so dass es zu Brüchen in der Informationskette und Intransparenzen kommt. Das unzureichende oder fehlende Wissen über den aktuellen Behandlungs- und Gesundheitsstatus eines Patienten erschwert die weitere Behandlung und wirkt sich negativ auf die Patientensicherheit und die Kosteneffizenz der Leistungserbringer aus. Durch fehlende Interoperabilität zwischen den unterschiedlichen Informationssystemen sind Gesundheitseinrichtungen, Ärzte und Patienten digital voneinander entkoppelt.\n\nDer Patient als Informationsquelle und -Verteiler\n\nDurch die fehlende Synchronisation von Patientendaten zwischen verschiedenen Einrichtungen in der Versorgungskette kommt dem Patienten eine besondere Rolle als Informationsübermittler zu. Einerseits muss er möglichst lückenlos über seine bisherige Krankengeschichte (je nach Fall über mehrere Jahre in die Vergangenheit) berichten können aber auch medizinisches Fachpersonal hinsichtlich bestehender Vorerkrankungen, Medikation, Unverträglichkeiten, Allergien, etc. aufklären können. Gerade bei älteren oder geistig beeinträchtigten Patienten sind Informationslücken oft unvermeidlich. Zusätzlich werden Dokumente wie Arztbriefe oder Ergebnisse aus bildgebenden Verfahren dem Patienten bei der Entlassung/Überstellung persönlich mitgegeben. Damit trägt der Patient auch selbst ein unnötig hohes Maß an Verantwortung für einen optimalen Behandlungsverlauf und dessen Dauer.\n\nDie elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) soll diesen Herausforderungen begegnen und bildet aktuell das Kernthema in deutschen Krankenhäusern und Pflegeeinrichtungen in puncto Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens.\n\nDie elektronische Patientenakte – viele Modelle und kaum Vernetzung\n\nAktuelle Situation\n\nBereits 2004 mit dem GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz wurde die ePA als eine der Anwendungen der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte (eGK) genannt. Seit dem wurde mehr als eine Milliarde Euro in das Projekt investiert und noch immer nutzen Patienten in Deutschland keine elektronische Gesundheitskarte.\n\nIn dem 2015 verabschiedeten E-Health-Gesetz wurde die ePA als wesentlicher Teil der künftigen Telematikinfrastruktur (TI) genannt. Die TI, welche von der Betriebsgesellschaft gematik entwickelt wird, soll dabei das digitale Kommunikationsnetz und die Grundlage für die ePA und das elektronische Patientenfach bilden. Bis zum 01.01.2019 sollen alle Ärzte, Psychotherapeuten, Krankenhäuser und anderen Akteure des Gesundheitswesens daran angebunden sein.\n\nLaut Gesetz soll die ePA den Not­fall­daten­satz, den Medikationsplan, Arztbriefe und weitere medizinische Dokumente, wie etwa den elektronischen Impfpass, aufnehmen.\n\nAnders als das ebenfalls vorgesehene ePF, erfordert die ePA als Zugriffsberechtigung den elektronischen Heilberufsausweis des behandelnden Arztes. Im ePF wiederrum sollen dem Versicherten die Inhalte seiner Patientenakte in ein sogenanntes Patientenfach gespiegelt werden, damit der Patient auch unabhängig von einem Arztbesuch darauf zugreifen kann. Über die Daten der Akte hinaus, soll der Patient hier auch die Möglichkeit erhalten, persönliche Gesundheitsdaten einzutragen.\n\nMit einheitlichen Standards und Spezifikationen sollen Insellösungen vermieden werden. Im E-Health Gesetz ist davon allerdings nichts zu lesen. Dafür existierten heute bereits parallel verschiedene gesetzliche Grundlagen zur Umsetzung von elektronischen Akten:\n\nIn § 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 4 SGB V - elektronische Patientenakte\nin § 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 5 SGB V - elektronisches Patientenfach\nin § 68 SGB V - elektronische Gesundheitsakte\nin § 630f BGB – elektronische Arztakte\n\nMilliardenschwere Digitalprojekte auf Basis von confusion-by-design haben es schwer. Daher ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, dass bereits ein E-Health Gesetz II in Arbeit ist. In der Zwischenzeit haben bereits einige Versicherer Ihre eigenen Pilotprojekte in Betrieb genommen. Natürlich mit unterschiedliche Strategien und mit unterschiedlichen Varianten der elektronischen Patientenakte.\n\nVarianten von Patientenakten\n\nEinrichtungsübergreifende Patientenakte (eEPA)\nBei diesem Konzept werden alle Informationen die bei der Behandlungen eines Patienten anfallen für Gesundheitsversorgungseinrichtungen fallübergreifend hinweg bereitgestellt. Eintragungen erfolgen ausschließlich über Ärzte und ähnliche Behandlungsmitglieder. Die Akte wird dauerhaft geführt, so dass eine gesamtheitliche Versorgung des Patienten über alle bisherigen oder bestehenden Krankheiten möglich ist. Einträge können von Leistungserbringern über ein Portal oder über das Primärsystem heraus an die eEPA übermittelt werden – Die Interoperabilität zwischen den Systemen vorausgesetzt. Die eEPA sieht abseits von der Datenfreigabe keine Einsicht oder Mitwirkung durch den Patienten selbst vor.\n\nElektronische Fallakte (eFA)\nDie eFA ist ärztlich geführt und moderiert. Sie wird einrichtungsübergreifend eingesetzt und ausschließlich fallbezogen geführt. Die eFA hat zum Ziel, eine optimale Koordination der Versorgung in den einzelnen Behandlungseinrichtungen zu ermöglichen. Im Gegensatz zur eEPA wird sie nach Fallabschluss geschlossen, der Lebenszyklus der Akte fällt dementsprechend kurz aus. Die Daten in der eFA werden über die Primärsysteme zur Verfügung gestellt. Auch hier gibt der Patient seine Einwilligung über die Datennutzung generell, ein Zugriff auf Patientenseite findet nicht statt.\n\nPersönliche, einrichtungsübergreifende Gesundheits- und Patientenakte (PEPA)\nDieses Konzept bindet den Patienten bei der Bereitstellung, Einsicht und Freigabe von Gesundheitsdaten aktiv mit ein. Über ein Patientenportal hat der Patient die Möglichkeit z.B. Arztbriefe selbstständig einzustellen (Patienten-Selbstmanagement). Auch hat der Patient die Möglichkeit selbst zu bestimmen, welche Daten in der Akte gespeichert werden und wer darauf Zugriff haben soll. Die PEPA ist wie die ePA eine fallübergreifende bzw. lebenslange Akte und wird sowohl vom Patienten als auch Ärzten dezentral oder über angebundene Primärsysteme gepflegt.\n\nElektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA)\nDie elektronische Gesundheitsakte wird häufig mit der elektronischen Patientenakte gleichgesetzt. Da letztere aber bis auf die PEPA rein ärztlich geführt ist, ist die eGA so ausgelegt, dass der Patient alleiniger Herr seiner Daten ist und diese beliebig anreichern kann. Versicherte sollen selbst entscheiden können, welche Diagnosen oder Medikamente sie darauf speichern möchten und wem sie Einsicht gewähren wollen. Voraussetzung ist, dass die eGA das Erheben, Verarbeiten und Nutzen von Daten über Befunde, Diagnosen, Therapien, Behandlungsberichte sowie Impfungen für eine fall- und einrichtungsübergreifende Dokumentation über den Patienten unterstützt\n\nTechnische Standards\n\nAus der Notwendigkeit einer einheitlichen Kommunikation und der Herstellung von Interoperabilität, haben sich verschiedene Standards entwickelt, die den technischen Kontext für elektronische Patientenakten bilden.\n\nIntegrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHR)\nIHE ist eine internationale, gemeinnützige Initiative aus Industrie und Fachanwendern, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat, die Interoperabilität zwischen IT-Systemen im Gesundheitswesen sicherzustellen. Die von IHE entwickelten Standards (IHE-Profile) unterstützen eine Vielzahl klinischer Prozesse und enthalten auch optionale Funktionen und sind bestimmten Domänen z.B. für Augenheilkunde, Radiologie, Technische Infrastruktur, etc. zugeordnet. Für den Einsatz von elektronischen Patientenakten ist das IHE Profil XDS (Cross-Enterprise Dokument Sharing) hervorzuheben, welches eine standardisierte Spezifikation für die gemeinsame, einrichtungsübergreifende Nutzung von Dokumenten beschreibt.\n\nHL7\nHL7 ist, ähnlich wie IHR, eine internationale Gruppe, die einheitliche Standards für den Datenaustausch zwischen verschiedenen Gesundheitsinstitutionen- und Systemen entwickelt. Die entwickelten Normen haben die Interoperabilität von verschiedenen Herstellern und Betreibern zum Ziel z.B. zwischen Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) und Praxisverwaltungssystemen (PVS) niedergelassener Ärzte. Der aktuellste Standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) vereinigt die Vorteile der etablierten HL7-Standard-Produktlinien und aktuellen Web-Standards (z.B. XML, JSON, ATOM, HTTPS, OAuth) und legt Wert auf einfache Implementierbarkeit und unterstützt die Entwicklung von mobile und cloud-basierte Anwendungen.\nDICOM®\nDICOM® steht für Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine und ist der internationale Standard zum Übertragen, Speichern, Abrufen, Drucken, Verarbeiten und Anzeigen von medizinischen Bildinformationen. Die meisten Hersteller von Systeme für bildgebende Verfahren wie Röntgen, MRT, CT haben den Standard in ihren Produkten implementiert. Dadurch wird eine hohe Interoperabilität im Umfeld verschiedener Gesundheitseinrichtungen ermöglicht. DICOM bildet auch die Grundlage für die digitale Bildarchivierungsystemen sog. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).\n\nAktuelle Praxisbeispiele\n\nVivy-App\n\nDie vom gleichnamigen Unternehmen entwickelte App „Vivy“ wurde in Kooperation von 90 gesetzlichen Krankenkassen und vier privaten Krankenversicherungen auf den Weg gebracht. Die in einem deutschen Rechenzentrum gespeicherten Daten sind Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselt und können über ein gekoppeltes Smartphone mit 2-Faktor-Authentifizierung vom Patienten eingesehen werden. Die App ermöglicht den Upload von medizinischen Daten und Dokumenten. Die App soll nicht nur die Gesundheitsakte sondern zudem den Impfpass, den Medikationsplan, Notfalldaten, einen Gesundheits-Check sowie eine Arztsuche beinhalten. Mittels Barcode-Scan von Medikamenten sollen auch mögliche Wechselwirkungen aufgezeigt werden. Da die App das DICOM-Format beherrscht, können auch Daten wie aus bildgebenden Verfahren importiert werden. Der Patient entscheidet, welche Informationen er mit Ärzten und Gesundheitseinrichtungen teilt und kann auch Dokumente löschen. Beim Verlust des Schlüssel sind die Daten allerdings unwiederbringlich verloren. Vivy soll als persönliche Gesundheitsassistent-App für 25 Mio. Versicherte kostenfrei zur Verfügung gestellt werden.\n\nTK-Safe – Techniker Krankenkasse\n\nEin ähnliches Konzept wie Vivy stellte Ende April die Techniker Krankenkasse mit ihrer bundesweiten elektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA) namens TK-Safe vor. Die zusammen mit IBM entwickelte eGA ermöglicht es den Versicherten, alle der TK vorliegenden Daten über ihr Smartphone in ihre Akte zu laden. Dazu zählen Impfungen, verordnete Medikamente, ärztliche Diagnosen oder auch Röntgenbilder oder Entlassungsdokumente. Die Daten werden zentral Secure Cloud von IBM in Frankfurt am Main gespeichert und sind Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselt. Zur Sicherheitsinfrastruktur gehört eine Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung aus regis­triertem Smartphone und Passworteingabe, bevor der Versicherte in seine eGA gelangt. Auch hier bedeutet der Verlust des Schlüssel einen unweigerlichen Verlust der Daten.Weder die TK noch IBM haben Zugriff auf die Daten und der Patient allein entscheidet ob und ich welchem Umfang ärztliches Personal darauf Zugriff erhalten.\n\nBislang werden die Daten bei Versicherungswechsel oder bei 12-monatiger Nichtnutzung nach 28 Tagen gelöscht. Perspektivisch soll es aber auch möglich sein, die Daten zu anderen Versicherung mitzunehmen. Eine spätere Anbindung an die Telematikinfrastruktur ist geplant. TK-Safe soll künftig mit dem elektronischen Patientenfach kompatibel sein. Das Partnernetzwerk umfasst 16 Kliniken und Betreibergesellschaften wie Agaplesion, die Helios Kliniken, Vivantes und dem Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf. TK-Safe steht bundesweit ca. 10 Mio. Versicherten zur Verfügung.\n\nPEPA – Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg (UKHD)\n\nDas Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg bietet bereits seit 2014 eine persönliche, einrichtungsübergreifende Gesundheits- und Patientenakte für Patienten im Rhein-Neckar-Raum an. Relevante Dokumente und Bilddaten können über standardisierte Schnittstellen Die Primärsysteme der teilnehmenden Einrichtungen werden auf Basis internationaler und offener Standards (HL7, DICOM) sowie Profile (IHE) in die PEPA für die Übermittlung von Inhalten integriert. Voraussetzung dafür ist die Einwilligung des Patienten. Die Einwilligung erfolgt direkt vor Ort im jeweiligen System des Kooperationspartners (Krankenhausinformationssystem oder Praxisverwaltungssystem). Auf diese Weise kann der Patient für jede Einrichtung separat entscheiden, ob und wem er Zugriff auf seine Gesundheitsdaten ermöglichen möchte. Sämtliche Daten liegen auf gesicherten Servern des UKHD. Über das persönliche Patientenportal können Nutzer auf Ihre PEPA jederzeit zugreifen, Zugriffsfreigaben managen und sehen wer die Daten verwendet hat. Zusätzlich sind im Portal zertifizierte Informationsmaterialien abrufbar, die dabei helfen komplexe Befunde zu verstehen. Features wie ein Medikationsplan oder die Möglichkeit ein Sport- oder Schmerztagebuch zu führen sind ebenfalls integriert. Fragebögen für Forschungszwecke können auch direkt über das Smartphone beantwortet werden, sofern der Patient hierfür seine Einwilligung erteilt. Künftig soll die PEPA auch mit der eGA TK-Safe vernetzt werden, so dass die Daten zwischen den Systemen ausgetauscht werden können. An die PEPA sind aktuell das UKHD und die Thoraxklinik Heidelberg sowie regionale Praxen angeschlossen. Das Krankenhaus Salem in Heidelberg und das Kreiskrankenhaus Bergstraße sind in Vorbereitung für eine Anbindung.\n\nFazit\n\nAktuell tritt genau das ein, was von Seiten der Politik, Spitzenverbänden aus Medizin und Versicherern und Ärzteschaft vermieden werden sollte: Die Entstehung von Insellösungen. Durch fehlende Spezifikationen, langwierige Entwicklungsprozesse bei der TI, ePA/ePF und fehlende gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen entwickeln Akteure im Gesundheitswesen und Ihre Partner eigene Lösungen.\n\nEine übergreifende Interoperabilität zwischen den Systemen scheint aber noch in weiter Ferne, vor allem da noch viele Versicherer keine eigene ePA-Strategie entwickelt haben und die künftige Telematikinfrastruktur weiter auf sich warten lässt. Bei über 70 Mio. gesetzlich Versicherter in Deutschland erreichen die bisherigen Konzepte daher noch nicht einmal die Hälfte aller möglichen Nutzer in Deutschland.\nAuf der anderen Seite darf für Kliniken und Ärzte die Dokumentation in der ePA zu keinem bürokratischen Mehraufwand führen, was eine tiefe Integration in die genutzten Primärsysteme erfordert. Bislang können diese entscheiden, auf welches Konzept sie mit aufspringen wollen. Ob sich dieses am Ende durchsetzt bzw. für einen übergreifenden Datenaustausch verfügbar, bleibt offen. Die Auswahl der \"richtigen\" Lösung ist damit entscheidend für den Einstieg in die digitale Patientenakte und für nachhaltige Kostenersparnisse im Gesundheitssektor.\n\nÜber Moritz Bachmann\n\nAls Inbound Sales Manager bildet Moritz Bachmann die Schnittstelle zwischen dem internen Online-Marketing und dem Bereich Sales bei comwrap.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday highs earlier in the session.\n\nTraders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and China could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to drift and bond prices to go higher.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war. The next round of tariffs is due to start in mid-December.\n\nOil fell after sources told Reuters that Russia is unlikely to agree to cut its oil output further at a meeting with fellow exporters next month.\n\nSeparately, Norway’s October oil production beat forecasts and the potential oversupply, combined with some worries over global demand next year, sent prices lower.\n\n“Moreover, Russia also failed to fulfill its agreed cuts in November so far,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 fell 3.38% to $55.12 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $60.73, down 2.74% on the day.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.2 points, or 0.36%, to 27,934.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.85 points, or 0.06%, to 3,120.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.72 points, or 0.24%, to 8,570.66.\n\nHopes of a trade truce earlier in the day drove European stocks to a four-year high and a measure of world stock markets to their highest in nearly two years, but those gains were pared later in the session.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.12% while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02% eking out its seventh straight session of gains.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.48%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.68% higher, while Japan’s Nikkei futures NKc1 lost 0.66%.\n\nLong-dated U.S. Treasury yields slipped as risk appetite weakened.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.786%, down from 1.808% late on Monday.\n\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.252%, from 2.293% late on Monday.\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.05%, with the euro EUR= up 0.05% to $1.1075.\n\nWhile the dollar was supported by recent U.S. economic data meeting lowered expectations, the greenback may be in for some weakness, said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc.\n\n“Central banks cannot provide that much to incentivize stocks any higher, thus risk-appetite is muted and the buck may continue to lose based on the fact that the American economy is indeed slower and the Fed’s ability to satisfy anyone is in question,” Perez said.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 108.55 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2925, down 0.21% on the day.\n\nSpot gold XAU= added 0.1% to $1,472.19 an ounce.\n\nCopper CMCU3 rose 0.86% to $5,880.00 a tonne.\n\nThree-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to $1,737.00 a tonne.\n\n(Graphic: Global assets in 2019 - here)\n\n(Graphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - here)\n\n(Graphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - here)\n\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan Grebler\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n0 : 0\n\nnarrow-browser-and-phone\nmedium-browser-and-portrait-tablet\nlandscape-tablet\nmedium-wide-browser\nwide-browser-and-larger\nmedium-browser-and-landscape-tablet\nmedium-wide-browser-and-larger\nabove-phone\nportrait-tablet-and-above\nabove-portrait-tablet\nlandscape-tablet-and-above\nlandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser\nportrait-tablet-and-below\nlandscape-tablet-and-below\n\nApps\nNewsletters\nAdvertise with Us\nAdvertising Guidelines\nCookies\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

It will house the local police force's offices, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The house's future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that this building will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism,\" Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn, who serves in a provisional government of civil servants, said in the statement.\n\nArchitects from across the European Union will be invited to submit plans for the building's redesign this month and a jury of experts and public officials will pick the winning design in the first half of next year, the Interior Ministry said.\n\nAlthough Hitler was born in Braunau in 1889, Austria argued for decades that it was the first victim of National Socialism, having been annexed by Hitler's Germany in 1938.\n\nRecent governments have, however, recognized that Austrians were also perpetrators of Nazi crimes and that there was little resistance to Hitler's rule.\n\nReuters\n\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\nPrivacy policy\nTerms of Service\nNBCNews.COM Site Map\nAdvertise\nAdChoices\n\n© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Designed specifically for Intensive Care Units and released by Ascom, this innovative solution helps healthcare professionals gain instant visibility to patient status.\n\nBAAR, SWITZERLAND\n\nBased on Ascom’s connectivity, clinical workflow and mobility expertise, the Digistat Patient Watch solution provides clinicians throughout Europe with an innovative solution to address the needs of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This partnership further expands the existing global relationship between GE and Ascom.\n\nIn traditional ICUs, each patient is wired to up to ten medical equipment – from monitoring devices to ventilators or infusion pumps. These high-end technologies provide clinicians with critical information and alert them when staff intervention is required. But this can sometimes lead to alarm fatigue, with care givers being exposed to up to 1,000 alarms per shift [1], even though up to 99% of those do not even require clinical intervention [2].\n\nThe new alarm management solution called Digistat Patient Watch, collects data from a variety of devices connected to the patient providing a holistic view at the patient bedside level and at the ICU level. Clinicians gain visibility on patient status, highlighting alarms and warnings occurring on any connected device. This critical data can also be displayed on a handheld mobile device, such as the Ascom Myco 2 which is designed specifically for clinical staff. The benefits for healthcare professionals may include helping improve staff efficiency, supporting better organization of patient care and implementing procedures to reduce the number of alarms.\n\n“Digistat Patient Watch helps clinicians leverage patient data to increase situational awareness and align priorities. It has the potential to change their practice and improve workflow efficiency” says André Neu, Head of Platform Solutions for Ascom.\n\n“Digistat Patient Watch is an important addition to GE Healthcare’s portfolio of solutions for the Intensive Care, and we are delighted with this expanded collaboration with Ascom”, adds Olivier Bosc, General Manager of Life Care Solutions Europe at GE Healthcare.\n\nFor more information on the Digistat Patient Watch solution, as well as on Ascom’s innovative clinical care solutions, please visit: www.ascom.com\n\n[1] Alarm fatigue: impacts on patient safety, Ruskin KJ, Hueske-Kraus D.

(AP) — The Latest on a deadly stabbing on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train (all times local):\n\n10 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say a stabbing that killed a passenger on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train may have occurred after the attacker tried to steal another rider’s shoes.\n\nThe fight broke out Tuesday afternoon on a BART train pulling into a station in Hayward.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle says police are looking into whether the victim was a good Samaritan who tried to stop the suspect from stealing items from another person, possibly shoes.\n\nThe man ran from the station. The Chronicle says he was arrested a block away after employees of a car dealership said he tried to steal a van.\n\nEmployee Steve Castro tells the paper that he fought with the shirtless man, who snatched the keys from his hand as he was showing the van to a customer.\n\n___\n\n4:14 p.m.\n\nA California transit chief says a man has been stabbed to death on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train during a fight.\n\nInterim BART Police Chief Ed Alvarez told reporters at a news conference that officials began receiving 911 calls Tuesday afternoon about a fight aboard a train between two men.\n\nHe says transit officers boarded the train at the next stop and found a man bleeding, who was possibly the victim of a stabbing. He says the man died.\n\nAlvarez says transit officers quickly searched the area and were able to apprehend a suspect.\n\nHe said there is no threat to the public because it was a fight between two people who engaged each other.\n\nOfficials did not immediately provide any other details.\n\nMost Popular\n\n1\n\nThis Bay Area zip code ranks as the most expensive in the country\n\n2\n\nWitness cheered for correcting Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan\n\n3\n\nFor years, people pinned dollar bills to the ceiling of Alameda bar.

As they stepped outside the airport, one after the other, they appeared sad. Some said they felt dejected that they could not realise their American dream even after several attempts.\n\n“This was the fourth time I have been deported,” said Singh Jabarjung, 24, from Punjab’s Bhatinda.\n“I boarded a flight on May 15 and reached Mexico via Moscow and Paris. From there, I tried to enter California on May 16 but was caught by police and deported from Arizona,” he said.\n\nHe said he has spent Rs 24 lakh in the four attempts and Rs 40 lakh on advocacy. Lakshiwnder Singh, another deportee, said he had given Rs 25 lakh to an Amritsar-based agent to help him enter the US. “He sent me to Mexico on May 2 via Moscow and Paris. They caught me while I was trying to cross the border and deported here from Arizona in US,” he said.\n\nThe special aircraft carrying the deportees landed at the T3 terminal of the Delhi airport at 6am, an airport official said. The aircraft reached India via Bangladesh. Following paper work with the immigration department, the deportees have started coming out of the airport. These 150 Indians have either violated their visa norms or were illegal immigrants, the officials said.\n\nOn October 18, more than 300 Indians, including one woman, were deported by Mexican immigration authorities for illegally entering the country to sneak into the US.

It is up to them to de-escalate, as others should tell them\n\nMon 18 Nov 2019 18.54 GMT Last modified on Mon 18 Nov 2019 18.56 GMT\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare via Email\n\n‘Excessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement.’ Photograph: AFP via Getty\n\nH ong Kong is burning. The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On Monday, the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that there is “absolutely no room for compromise”. But it is not merely that Beijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue to escalate the crisis.\n\nAs the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University was besieged by police, who fired round after round of teargas at protesters attempting to flee the scene. The message – no way out – was all the more disturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if petrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds trapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a bishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were prevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong’s legislative council was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents launched “save the students” marches converging upon the campus, they too faced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol bombs.\n\nExcessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these protests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far broader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they should support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late. Meanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for challenging authorities.\n\nThough many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded with unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and were rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a protester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between protesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames those in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause: defending Hong Kong’s way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but dramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People’s Liberation Army took to the city’s streets to clear barricades this weekend: a “voluntary clean-up activity” which acted as a reminder that the Chinese military could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise their presence.\n\nThe movement’s resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the mainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in Xinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled, the mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities originated in directives from Xi to “show absolutely no mercy” in the “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”. Many in Hong Kong fear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further repression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even insurgency, that some have called the “Belfastisation” of the city.\n\nFurther afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing’s chagrin, the prospects of Taiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive party, as she faces next year’s election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.\n\nChina’s leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since 1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square, and witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has calculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible – but not by offering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that from Britain. Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that they are watching.\n\nTopics\n\nHong Kong\nOpinion\n\nProtest\nAsia Pacific\nCommunism\nXi Jinping\nChina\neditorials\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare via Email\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on WhatsApp\nShare on Messenger\n\nReuse this content\n\nMost popular\n\nThe Guardian view\nColumnists\nCartoons\nOpinion videos\nLetters\n\nNews\nOpinion\nSport\nCulture\nLifestyle\n\nContact us\nComplaints & corrections\nSecureDrop\nWork for us\nPrivacy policy\nCookie policy\nTerms & conditions\nHelp\n\nAll topics\nAll writers\nDigital newspaper archive\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\nAdvertise with us\nSearch UK jobs\nDating\nDiscount Codes\n\nSupport The Guardian\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\nContribute Subscribe\nBack to top\n© 2019 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a heck of a lot like the old 15-inch MacBook Pro, save for a few meaningful throwback features. Yes, I mean throwback as in retro—as in Apple actually took retired features from old MacBooks and reintroduced them as new features. It would seem that the future of innovation at the Cupertino-based computer company is what I’ll call rewind design.\n\nI’m not complaining. The 16-inch MacBook Pro looks like a hell of a laptop, as it should for a starting price of $2,400. The new machine comes with a bigger display, a bigger battery, better speakers, and a brand new AMD graphics card. Then there are those retro features. There’s a physical escape button just like there was on MacBook Pros before the rise of the Touch Bar. The arrow keys are once again arranged in an inverted “T” formation, as they had been on keyboards for decades. The new “Magic Keyboard” uses a scissor switch that’s almost identical to the Bluetooth-enabled Magic Keyboard that Apple released nearly five years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe keyboard thing is a big deal. Apple has been dealing with public outrage sparked by its newer butterfly mechanism in MacBook keyboards. This low-travel design contributed to the impossible thinness of the 12-inch MacBook released in 2015, before finding its way into all MacBook models in 2016. Even a small bit of dust or debris could disable a key, and fixing it required replacing the entire upper half of the laptop. Apple admitted to the flawed design and launched a limited repair program in June 2018, before it ultimately offered free keyboard repairs for all MacBook s with the new mechanism. The company was still trying to fix the scissor design as recently as May of this year when it launched an updated 15-inch MacBook Pro. Now, the cursed butterfly-powered MacBook keyboard is all but dead. The new keyboard design is expected to show up on smaller MacBooks in early 2020.\n\nBut the new design isn’t all that new. As iFixit points out in its teardown, the 16-inch MacBook’s keyboard is virtually identical to the well-loved Magic Keyboard from 2o15. In other words, Apple replaced a flawed design from 2015—one that it had tried and failed to perfect many times—with a design from 2015 that wasn’t so flawed. It’s almost as if Apple made the wrong decision almost five years ago, and in order to deal with that, it’s just going back in time and making the right decision. The same is true for the new physical escape button, which Apple had axed on most MacBook Pro models in 2016, and for the new inverted “T” arrow key layout, which Apple had done away with back in 2015.\n\nPhoto: iFixit\n\nThis is a curious way to design computers. It also seems like Apple’s MacBook team was really screwing up back in 2015. That was a time when the company’s design team decided to fix a few things that weren’t broken and break a few more things in the process. Now, to fix those problems, Apple is just replacing the broken new things with near-identical versions of the old things, effectively putting its design process in reverse. If you liked the crispiness and ease of the newer scissor mechanism on the big MacBook Pro, too bad. Apple failed at perfecting its promising design so it just switched back to the old one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce again, I’m not complaining. As one of the many thousands of people with broken MacBook keyboards, I welcome the return of the more robust design of the Magic Keyboard. I have one of the old Magic Keyboards on my desk, and I love it! I especially love how the keys don’t break constantly. And while we’re on the topic, I also miss having an escape key. My 15-inch MacBook Pro has a Touch Bar, which I hate—although I would hate it slightly less if it had a physical escape key. I’m honestly impartial on the inverted “T” arrow key thing, but I know some people are passionate about it.\n\nWhat does bug me about Apple’s new take on innovation is that it confirms the belief that the company seldom has new ideas. I wrote a long rant about this last year when it was apparent that Apple focuses less on hardware innovation and more on money-making services. That prediction, unfortunately, turned out to be true. In recent months, we’ve seen the release of a new iPhone, which amounted to the old iPhone plus an extra camera, as well as the new Apple TV+ streaming service, which is a bit bland. They’re not bad products. But they’re certainly not groundbreaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same appears to be true for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I’ll reserve final judgment until I’ve had time to test the new laptop, and given my penchant for an operational keyboard and an escape key, I bet I’ll like it. I just can’t stop wondering if I’ll ever see another new Apple product that warps my understanding of technology the way that the iPod or the iPhone did so many years ago. It’s possible that Apple will do it with some sort of augmented reality headset in the next couple of years. Maybe its designers have been so busy working on that futuristic product that they couldn’t focus on perfecting keyboard design. Surely they’ve been busy doing better things.\n\nShare This Story\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nYep, There's a Giant New MacBook Pro, and Yep, Apple Improved Its Keyboard\n\nApple Finally Did the Right Thing (Sort of)\n\nHere's a First Look at the New MacBook Pro Keyboard\n\nApple's Future Looks Rotten\n\nTry to Hate the iPhone 11 Pro\n\nApple Just Gutted Its Laptop Lineup\n\nAbout the author\n\nAdam Clark Estes\nAdam Clark Estes\n\nSenior editor at Gizmodo.\n\nEmail Twitter Posts Keys\nPGP Fingerprint: 91CF B387 7B38 148C DDD6 38D2 6CBC 1E46 1DBF 22A8 • PGP Key\nOTR Fingerprint: D9330D9B 6CF5E271 7FAC6194 DAA9B51B E09A99B2\nShare\nTweet"

Sonos Move. Galaxy Note 10. See what else made our list for best tech gadgets of the past year.\n\nBy Jason Cipriani | November 18, 2019 -- 19:14 GMT (19:14 GMT) | Topic: Hardware\n\n(Image: gargantiopa / Getty Images)\n\nBlack Friday\n\nBusiness Bargain Hunter's top picks\n\nThe very best Black Friday deals and sales.\n\nRead More\n\nAs the year comes to an end, it's time to sit back and reflect. This year we saw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple impresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech companies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\n\nAlso: See Black Friday coverage at CNET\n\nSurely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along with the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to keep on an eye out for the best deals.\n\nSome of 2019's best tech gadgets\n\nDisclosure: ZDNet may earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\nApple AirPods Pro for $235\n\nSee it now: Amazon\n\nSince the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been asking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple finally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new design sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments, and comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit.\n\nNintendo\n\nNintendo Switch Lite for $200\n\nSee it now: Amazon\n\nThe smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into a dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The screen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently attached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch that users love and embrace.\n\nSonos\n\nSonos Move for $400\n\nSee it now: Amazon\n\nSonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment speakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable. With Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest of its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close the nearest power outlet is.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon Echo Buds for $130\n\nSee it now: Amazon\n\nIn many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have been well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds have Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and Android devices.\n\nApple iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nApple, Inc.\n\nApple iPhone 11 Pro Max for $999\n\nSee it now: Apple\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what it did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an amazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that battery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get this year.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840\n\nSee it now: Samsung\n\nArguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed, has a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep up with whatever you throw at it.

I’ve got to say, I’m impressed! The level of detail is superb, with very clear diagrams and instruction – particularly useful are the exploded drawings which feature regularly, and really help you to see how things come apart (and go back together).\n\nAdvert\n\nI was a little wary at the title of this book – described as for the ‘CBR600F4’, this is of course the US version of the Honda I own. I needn’t have worried – the UK bikes are fully covered, with all wiring diagrams and other areas clearly labeled for each market.\n\nWorking on your own bike can be incredibly rewarding, so besides the fact that these manuals can save you a small fortune, the gratification of servicing and maintaining your motorcycle make them worth every penny (and they more than pay for themselves even with a simple oil-change).\n\nAdvert\n\nGet Motor Cycle Monthly delivered through your letterbox every month. 12 issues for £11.99.

The protests began peacefully in June and were sparked by proposed legislation that would have meant criminal suspects could be extradited to the mainland. Although the bill was withdrawn, the protests had broadened into a resistance movement against the territory’s government and Beijing.\n\nRelated articles\n\nHong Kong uprising: Protestors send defiant warning to China\nHong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\nMany of the protesters wear masks to shield their identities for protection.\n\nChina’s ambassador to Britain accused the UK and the US of meddling in the country’s affairs and warned that the Chinese government “will not sit on our hands” if the Hong Kong situation “becomes uncontrollable”.\n\nCheuk Hau-yip, the commander of Kowloon West district, said: “These rioters, they are also criminals. They have to face the consequences of their acts.\n\nChina has warned they will cease control of Hong Kong (Image: GETTY )\n\nThe protests kicked off in June and have strengthened in size (Image: GETTY )\n\n“Other than coming out to surrender, I don’t see that there’s any viable option for them.”\n\nChina’s ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaming has said that China has the “resolution and power” to end Hong Kong unrest amid protests.\n\nLiu said that the People’s Liberation Army could be deployed in Beijing, warning: “They are already there in the Hong Kong garrison. They are there to show sovereignty and are responsible for defence purposes.\n\nSEE MORE: Hong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\nProtesters do not want Hong Kong to lose its autonomy (Image: getty )\n\n“If the situation becomes uncontrollable, the central government certainly would not sit on our hands and watch.

how they happened (Image: EXPRESS )\n\nChina said it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula granting Hong Kong autonomy, while the city’s police deny accusations of brutality and say they show utmost restraint.\n\nThe UK has urged an “end to the violence and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue”.\n\nRelated articles\n\nCarol Vorderman showcases curves in clingy khaki to see Hong Kong\nHong Kong uprising: Protestors send defiant warning to China\nHong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\nChina\n\nMost read in World\n\nMunich incident: Police seal off major square for 'large-scale operation' after warning\n\nMexico earthquake: Huge 6.3 magnitude quake strikes – ‘seismic waves’ felt in Canada\n\nEU takeover: Italy's Salvini launches new attack on Brussels over 'dictatorial' policies\n\nHillary Clinton blasted over decision to exclude Thatcher from latest 'Gutsy Women' book\n\nDonald Trump's staff mock Macron's criticism of Nato – and warns EU can't defend itself\n\nLatest videos\n\nPhilip Hammond was May's NIGHTMARE: Inside story of how Remainer chancellor failed the PM\n\nUK weather forecast: Terrifying map shows COLLAPSED polar vortex freezing UK in December\n\nFlights: Passengers can fly for up to 80 percent less by travelling on this day\n\nRoyal wedding 2020: Will Princess Beatrice be allowed to wear a royal tiara?\n\nQueen and Prince Philip spend 72nd wedding anniversary apart after health concerns\n\nMichelle Obama heartache: Ex-FLOTUS shares emotional video for launch of new journal\n\nMelania Trump sparks Twitter fury after FLOTUS hosts Billy Ray Cyrus for BeBest meeting\n\nIran protests: At least 106 dead in violent clashes as Tehran reaches boiling point\n\nBlack Death RETURNS: World struck by bubonic plague -

You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.\n\nIt’s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it’s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.\n\nWhere it’s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.\n\nFallen Order’s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game’s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era’s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.\n\nOne of the narrative’s strongest elements is that it doesn’t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There’s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn’t matter to the general story.\n\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez’s ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year’s best new character.\n\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction – and my god, every little animation he plays – both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2’s BT-7274.\n\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn’t so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\n\nThis means you’ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn’t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don’t always need to follow the quest marker if you don’t want to.\n\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it’s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.\n\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It’s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware’s work, which is what makes the map – available to you at any point – such a lifesaver.\n\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren’t. They’re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It’s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake’s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn’t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.\n\nIn your adventures, you’ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they’re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however – units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\n\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they’re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.\n\nThe best new character in 2019.\n\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\n\nYou’re going to parry the basic trooper’s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You’ll watch for the melee trooper’s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you’ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you’ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\n\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you’re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.\n\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\n\nFallen Order’s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don’t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.\n\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you’ll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It’s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution.\n\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you’ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it’s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\n\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There’s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents’ guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry.\n\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can’t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don’t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They’ll often continue their combo unabated and you’ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren’t working.\n\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn’t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack.\n\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could’ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn’t hook me.\n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all – at the game’s worst moments – lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually – but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren’t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I’ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don’t always win.\n\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting – but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.\n\nAnd yes, it doesn’t always get there in this one, but damn If I can’t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It’s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn’t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent – albeit flawed – combat.\n\nVersion tested: PC.\n\nSometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been rallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with macroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.\n\nWhy is the market behaving differently from the economy?\n\n\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three positive indicators for growth – reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed divestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-China trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we expect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities.\n\nClose\n\nExperts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a recovery in the economy.\n\nrelated news\n\nFIIs bullish on India, growth should start accelerating in Q2CY20, says Ridham Desai\n\nTaking Stock: Historic day on D-St! Here's what is driving the rally\n\n\"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a reasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\nA key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.\n\nThe September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of the companies reported in-line or better than expected results.\n\nTax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The key positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front (sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely neutral, say experts.\n\n\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate tax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.\n\nFor the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the concerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\n\nBank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza attributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar Steel resolution.\n\n\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should be seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in bidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will be high now,\" said Oza.\n\nGlobal financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the Essar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured banks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.\n\nNear-term consolidation likely\n\nHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.\"\n\nThe hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings should not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\n\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several structural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or investment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the high government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\nAn extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent revival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\n\nComing back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the market and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\n\nPankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is a stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the benchmark.\n\n\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far, it looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.\n\nThe valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.\n\nThe Indian market’s high valuations are being supported by a combination of factors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a China-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's expectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\n\n\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the market’s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and strong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

While it looks quite familiar, Apple's new flagship laptop moves the needle forward in a big way. We've spent the last several days taking the new Pro for a spin and can say that Apple has dutifully listened to users' feedback this time around. Let's talk about it.\nApple's 16-inch MacBook Pro\nWe're not certain when Apple last issued four updates to the MacBook Pro within 18 months, or to any laptop it has ever produced. But, here we are.\nJust months after the last i9 MacBook Pro was released, Apple has unveiled its 16-inch MacBook Pro. The surface changes aren't even obvious — the monitor is about a half an inch larger on the diagonal, and you can't even tell that the machine is larger than the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro design.\nInterestingly, it is actually smaller and thinner than the 2012 through 2015 model. You also can't tell unless you're looking at the three together.\nSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTube\nThere are three main configurations of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, one with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, a 2.3GHz i9 model, and a 2.4GHz i9 configuration —effectively the same options as the 15-inch MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019. Depending on model, there are options for a AMD Radeon Pro 5300M or 5500M. For this review, we're examining the 2.4GHz 16-inch MacBook Pro, with 512GB of flash storage, 32GB of RAM, and the Radeon Pro 5500M. The retail price on this configuration is $3,299.\n\n16-inches instead of 15.4\n\nThis will matter to you a great deal, or it won't, and even before you started reading this, you already knew if it mattered to you or not. In our eyes, there are more important aspects to the 16-inch MacBook Pro redesign than the screen, though.\nWhat we will say, is if you are staring at a 15-inch MacBook Pro right next to the 16-inch MacBook Pro you will notice a difference. The updated design looks better with slimmer bezels and an ever-so-slightly elevated pixel density going from 220 to 226ppi. That likely won't be a huge reason for users to upgrade though.\nThe slimmer bezels of the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nPros out there who are well-versed in the video space will appreciate one change to the display though, which is the ability to specifically choose your refresh rate. Heading to System Preferences, multiple options can be chosen from to best align with your work.\n\nKeyboard\n\nKeyboards are highly subjective. So highly subjective, in fact, that even if you like a mechanical keyboard, there are dozens of different iterations, with different key feels because assorted manufacturers believe that there is that much granularity in demand.\nSo, a little context is important. We're not giant fans of typing on glass, like the iPad. We didn't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard that was introduced with the 2016 MacBook Pro — but it wasn't a favorite of ours.\nInverted 'T' design for arrow keys\nWe get that the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard design, and iterations, are polarizing. Where the 2012 through 2015 design had the entire expression of keyboard like and hate, the 2016 through 2019 weighed more heavily on the \"it'll do\" to \"this is terrible\" range, with very, very few folks in the \"this is great\" zone.\nIn regards to reliability, across the entire AppleInsider staff, exactly one unit had to be replaced. We had the same failure rate with the 2012 through 2015 keyboard. And, the data we've been collecting on the 2018 model and the mid-2019 refresh suggests that whatever Apple did for reliability is working, with it having an equivalent failure rate in the first year to the 2012 through 2015 design.\nBeyond looking back, the key actuation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is punctuated by a soft click, most similar to the mid-2019 noise versus any other, if a bit quieter. Where the 2015 design noise was more from the key bottoming out the switch, if you press slowly, you can feel where the click is on the new computer, before hitting the bottom of the chamber. Gone is the clackety-clack of the original 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard, and you'll never mistake this keyboard for a desktop mechanical model.\nThere's more sensory data on the keys in the video that accompanies this piece. But, here are the numbers: the key travel on the 16-inch MacBook Pro keyboard is one millimeter. This is in comparison to between 0.6 and 0.7 millimeters on the 2016-style keyboard, and between 1.2 and 1.5 millimeters on the 2012 through 2015 style.\nTyping on the new MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard\nIn our testing, we had a baseline of 38 dBa of ambient noise measured with a Kanomax model 4431 audiometer, with the test gear at head height and distance. Typing on the 2016 MacBook Pro with no other CPU load brought that up to about 43 dBa. The highest we could manage on the 16-inch MacBook pro with a particularly angry bout of random key-mashing was 41 dBa. Quieter indeed.\nWith that 2016 redesign, Apple made a big deal about key stability being an underpinning of the design. In short, the new keyboard is more key travel than the 2016, but less than the 2012. Whatever Apple did for key stability in the 2016 was moved to the 16-inch MacBook pro — and this is a good thing.\nAnd, Apple tells us that individual keys can be replaced. We didn't get any information on what this entails, but at this juncture, it still looks like a complete disassembly is required to do so.\n\nTouch Bar and Escape Key\n\nThe new keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro has a physical escape key, and instead of the Touch ID sensor being connected to the Touch Bar, it is in its own little well. Coders have been clamoring for the former, and we think that Apple did the latter to ease repair, if that sensor needs to be replaced.\nIn our use, a physical escape key makes little difference — but for coders, it's an entirely different story. We've been told about times where things have gone completely awry, and the virtual escape key on the Touch Bar doesn't work at all, forcing a hard reboot.\nAs a general rule, we like what the Touch Bar brings. After a lukewarm initial impression. we've adopted it into our workflows. We're not going to say that everybody is going to like it, but utilities like Better Touch Tool open up a frontier of customization options, and we recommend it to anybody that has a Touch Bar and wants to use it beyond the Apple-sanctioned or developer-mandated uses.\n\nTesting the silicon\n\nApple did include the same CPU options as the mid-2019 predecessors but thanks to its new internals, it is able to get slightly better performance out of the chips. When we compared the 16-inch base to the previous 15-inch base, we saw that single-core scores increased from 1061 to 1128 and multi-core scores increased from 5425 to 5641 on Geekbench 5.\nIn Cinebench R20, scores jumped as well from 2395 to 2623. This is due to the machine being able to keep those cores cooler for longer.\nRunning the Browserbench.org Speedometer test that measures web app performance on each machine, the new machine scored a 129 while the previous generation clocked in at a 126.8.\n\nGPU\n\nFor the GPU, we turned once more to our usual Unigine Heaven benchmark. Running at full screen, with tesselation and stereo turned off, at medium quality (our standard settings), the new machine earned an average of 86.6 frames per second and a 2182 score. It maxed out at an impressive 162.1 frames per second.\nUnigine Heaven benchmark results for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\nImpressively, that beats the VEGA 20 graphics from the previous design which earned a total score of 2072 and a max FPS of 147.4. It also won on average FPS over the previous 82.3. Again, that is our base model compared to the previous high-end selection.\nIn another benchmark to test the performance of Metal, we ran the Geekbench 5 Compute test. The new base machine managed a 21757 while the previous base garnered only a 13919.\nLastly, we performed an export test. Exporting the same 4K 24FPS Final Cut Pro X project from both base units with the same settings. Final Cut was updated The previous generation took 4 minutes and 15 seconds while the updated machine did the export in only 2 minutes and 38 seconds.\n\nThermals\n\nThe 2018 15-inch i9 MacBook Pro was a very hot machine. While it still holds up, Apple has improved the situation greatly with the 16-inch MacBook pro.\nEight cores are hot. The 5500M chipset is toasty, and the RAM is too.\nIn our use, when the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro was under load, the keyboard's metal surface routinely hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit around the G, H, and J keys. That's still usable, but it is very, very warm. On the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, that area is still the hotspot, but it hit a maximum of 89 degrees while running under load.\nThere are still a large number of picky details to examine with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in regards to the thermal environment. We'll be looking a lot more at varying work environments including ambient temperature effects, and machine orientations as the weeks and months wear on to see if they make any difference at all to performance.\nBut, we're not expecting to see much difference this time around.\nIn regards to the revamped cooling system. Apple says that the 16-inch MacBook Pro has different fan blades and more surface area on all heat exchanging surfaces. This means that the computer sounds different under load.\nStrictly from a noise standpoint, in the same 38 dBA room, the 2016 MacBook Pro under heavy load is about 45 dBa at the same range that we did the keyboard testing. The 16-inch MacBook Pro hit a maximum of 44 dBa, with equivalent fan speeds to the 2016 model.\nThe MacBook Pro for the last seven years has sounded about the same. It's hard to describe how it sounds now, but there's a lower pitch and a different warble to the fans now, likely because of the new blade shape. You'll notice the difference if you're a long-time user, but it isn't distracting, and you'll forget the old sound pretty quickly.\nUsing Final Cut Pro X on the new MacBook Pro\nWe've only just started testing and thermal performance. Our initial testing suggests that the 16-inch MacBook Pro can maintain a higher clock speed for longer — which isn't well-reflected in benchmark testing to date.\nThe fans on the new MacBook Pro start to get audible in that 38 dBa office environment at about 83 degrees Celsius processor temperature. Based on observation, they start to pick up speed at about 75C — earlier than the 80C that the 2016 through 2019 MacBook Pro start to ramp up. We'll be testing this more in the future.\nThe efficacy of this thermal redesign in regards to your own workflow will vary very much depending on your individual workload. But, using a utility that turns off the boost feature on the processor essentially guarantees a silent machine with next to no fan noise, at a cost of taking about one and a half times longer to complete your job. We'll be talking about this in the future too.\n\nFlash speeds are still blistering\n\nThe drive is absolutely no slouch. Running the BlackMagic disk speed test after the machine had been indexing for two days, we saw a write speed of 2890 megabytes per second, and a read speed of 3150 megabytes per second on both a 512GB and 1TB model.\nThis is a bit faster than the i9 MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019, and about 350MB per second faster than the 2018 MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage or more.\n\nBattery life\n\nBattery is improved on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nThis time Apple baked in a new 100Wh battery that is necessary for the beefed-up internals. That new battery doesn't just match the last model's performance, it extends it. While we didn't have too much of a chance to surf the web for 11 hours on end, Apple says that is what you can expect — which is one hour more than the 15-inch offered.\n\nSpeakers\n\nWe didn't expect much change when it came to speakers, but after trying them out we were wowed.\nMoving between listening to our above test playlist reserved for speakers and headphones as well as Apple TV+ content with Dolby Atmos, it makes listening to content on a portable machine far more enjoyable.\nThere are six speakers in the new MacBook Pro\nBass was substantial, but thanks to the dual force-canceling drivers, it doesn't cause the machine to shake or feel uncomfortable at loud volumes.\nThe biggest note was how much larger and fuller the soundstage appeared as we listening to content from one machine to the other.\n\nWi-Fi 6\n\nOddly, Apple has a few omissions with the pro machine. The FaceTime camera is still capped at a meager 720p. But more frustrating, Apple has felt the need to hold back with 801.11ac Wi-Fi rather than jump to Wi-Fi 6 ax as we saw with the most recent iPhone launch.\nConsidering a Mac is intended to be a portable machine, the lack of the latest Wi-Fi tech is frustrating. Users rightly expect to pick up a Mac and use it for several years and investing in a new machine shouldn't be capped by previous standards. Especially one Apple has already adopted en masse with millions of iPhones.\nWi-Fi 6 is still launching and there is only a smattering of ax routers on the market so looking at today's landscape users aren't missing out, but they will when they have this machine in two-three years and Wi-Fi 6 has been more widely adopted.\nThere will certainly be some iPhone 11 Pro users who will jump on board with Wi-Fi 6 early to take advantage of it on their phones that will be left behind with the new MacBook Pro in that regard.\n\nStill four Thunderbolt 3\n\nApple has now redesigned the MacBook Pro, listening to pro users, and the HDMI port has not returned. Thunderbolt 3 is staying. It's past time to come to terms and deal with it.\nStill four Thunderbolt 3 ports\nThe USB-C physical connector on Thunderbolt 3 is not the end of the world, but it is an adjustment for users, if you're coming from a 2015 or older MacBook Pro. Complaints that there are multiple flavors of USB-C are correct, but this is more of an issue with cable labeling than anything else. That adjustment is better made, than tolerated using half-baked solutions.\nWe've said this before, many times: there is no special hardware required to connect a HDMI or DVI monitor. Given that the Thunderbolt 3 protocol explicitly contains the HDMI protocol, a cable will do, or a dongle if you prefer. There is no breakout box needed for USB-A connectors, and a peripheral cable or dongle there can be had too, depending on what you need.\nFortunately, since you have Thunderbolt 3, and not the other varieties of USB-C, cables are cheap, and plentiful. You can get there from here, and it isn't expensive to do so.\n16-inch MacBook Pro\nLike we've been saying for nearly four years now, if you're hell-bent on sticking with your existing cabling instead of adopting cables with a USB-C end is choosing from one of many a Thunderbolt dock. Thunderbolt 3 docks start at $199 retail, and USB 3.2 type C ones can be had for cheaper than that, if you don't need the full 40 gigabits per second that the faster protocol allows.\nIn our testing, with a two-hour load on the MacBook Pro using both the CPU and GPU, an 87W Thunderbolt 3 dock or power adapter still drained the battery to the tune of about 4% per hour. Under \"normal\" office use or similar work there was no drain at all.\nIf you have an older Thunderbolt dock from your 2012 or later Retina MacBook Pro, the $49 Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will connect that unit to the new machine. It won't supply power, but, fortunately, the 96W adapter that your machine came with will.\nFurthermore, if you're considering an external GPU, many of the enclosures have USB-A and Ethernet ports, in an accessory that costs not much more than a dock does. If all you need are a few USB-A ports, get a USB 3.0 dock, along with a USB-C to USB-B cable for around $8. Problem solved. Nothing that we've seen presently for eGPU enclosures provides 96W, but that will likely be rectified very soon.\nRegarding MagSafe, we've been testing USB-C for a very, very long time at this point, and our results are unchanged. On a melamine, Corian, or finished wood desk surface, the force required to pull out Apple's USB-C charging cable is about three-quarters of what it takes to break a MagSafe 2 connection, when the cable is pulled from less than a 40-degree angle from center on the horizontal plane, and less than 30 degrees from center on the vertical.\nThe 96W USB-C power adapter\nAnd, the AC adapter also has a USB-C connector with the same disconnect force, so now there are two rapid breakpoints in the case of an accident or inadvertent pull.\nApple's service numbers that we've collated bear out that the removal of official MagSafe hasn't caused any notable increase in incidents. MagSafe's introduction in January 2006 halved accidental damage service calls by 2009. There was no change in those numbers for MagSafe 2. But, in the three years since the MacBook Pro was released, there has been no increase in the accidental damage rate from a reported cable snag at all.\nWith a 11-hour battery, we're not sure why you'd want to string a power cord along a transit route anyway. If you're that concerned about it, buy a USB-PD battery and keep it next to your computer.\nIf you're still not happy that MagSafe is gone, there are inexpensive options on Amazon.\n\nThe MacBook Pro is a workhorse, but is not a desktop\n\nThe MacBook Pro is not going to be the same maximum speed as the Mac Pro. It isn't even going to top the iMac Pro in every regard. But, it is portable, and it is very, very fast.\nIf you're doing long runs of rendering or the like, the iMac Pro will work better for you. Despite some social media posts to the contrary, the iMac Pro is in no way a portable machine. While the new Mac Pro doesn't have those seemingly sharpened handles that the old-school Mac Pro did, it isn't really portable either, even if you spring for the wheels.\nAs the last two i9 MacBook Pro were, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a solid machine, one that is faster than literally every other MacBook Pro ever made, if not by a lot.\nNo matter how much of a Pro you are, not everything is a long processing job, constantly slamming the processor. Even most editing tasks aren't constantly pushing your CPU and GPU to the absolute limits. As we've said time and time again, considering your own workflow in regards to what you do most of the time is crucial in making this decision.\nEditing in the Final Cut Pro X on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\nIf you're coming from a 2018 or earlier MacBook Pro, including the i9 2018 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with either flavor of i9 processor is unquestionably a great choice. However, the real-world performance for nearly every task that you will do, minus those blue-moon processor-crushing ones, the i9 performance isn't supremely higher than that of the i7 \"baseline\" model.\nAs with every other i9 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a lot of computer, with a lot of power, for a lot of money. There are cheaper machines with the i9, dealing with many of the same thermal constraints, running Windows.\nHow much is macOS worth to you? You can say all you want that there are cheaper Windows options, and you'll be right. But, none of them bring macOS to the table.\nAs it was before, and as it remains, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an i9 processor is the right tool for macOS jobs that demand portability. It is not the ultimate solution to every macOS-centric computing problem, and those people that need that solution probably already know that they need to wait for the Mac Pro tower.\n\nScore 4.5 out of 5\n\nSave hundreds on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nApple resellers are accepting orders for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro with a variety of incentives. Expercom is knocking up to $438 off select new configurations with coupon code appleinsider, while Adorama is taking up to $250 off retail models with promo code APINSIDER (prices start at just $2,199 with code). Details can be found in this 16-inch MacBook Pro deal roundup.\nMeanwhile, at B&H, shoppers can save $100 on the retail systems and select between no interest financing when paid in full within 12 months with the B&H Financing Card or a sales tax refund in eligible states with its Payboo Credit Card. The latter can save many shoppers anywhere from $200 to $500 on average.\nAmazon is also offering instant discounts on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, matching B&H with prices as low as $2,299.\nBe sure to check out the AppleInsider 16-inch MacBook Pro Price Guide for the latest deals and product availability on Apple's new hardware.\nTopics:\n\nMacBook Pro,\nMac,\nReview,\nVideo,\nVideos\n\n(42) Comments\nTweet\n\nAppleInsider has affiliate partnerships and may earn commission on products purchased through affiliate links.

        "articleBody": "The Early Reviews For Google's Stadia Gaming Platform Are Here — And They're Not Great - Digg\n\nDigg\n\nFrontpage\nVideo\nStore\nPicks\n\nTechnology\nLong Reads\nPhotos\nScience\n\nDesign\nDigg Features\n₿itcoin\n\nSubscribe\nSearch\nSign In\n\nSTREAM BIG\n\nThe Early Reviews For Google's Stadia Gaming Platform Are Here — And They're Not Great\n\nDallas Robinson\nNov 18, 2019 @17:19 PM · Updated: Nov 18, 2019 @17:26 PM\n\nStadia, Google's streaming gaming platform, launches today. Is the service the first step towards the future of gaming, or will Stadia fall flat on its face? Here's what the early reviews say:\n\nWhat Does Stadia Offer?\n\nStadia is Google's attempt to make cloud gaming happen, and the company has promised a lot: the ability to play basically any game at up to 4K on your TV, phone, tablet or laptop, with no lag and on existing internet infrastructure. And, based on these broad qualifiers, Stadia delivers.\n\n[ Engadget ]\n\nStadia isn't a console. It's a platform for streaming games from the cloud. You can play Stadia titles on a TV, on a computer or on a smartphone, although there are limitations on all of these categories, as I'll discuss later. You buy whichever game you want to play from Google, then stream it right away. There's no initial download, no patching and no buffering — just instantaneous gameplay.\n\n[ Tom's Guide ]\n\nStadia Is Essentially A Beta Version Until 2020, But The Price Tag Isn't Cheap\n\nCome November 19, those who anted up $129 for the Google Stadia Founder's Edition or functionally identical Premiere Edition will receive a Stadia controller, a 4K-ready Chromecast Ultra, and three months of the $10-a-month Stadia Pro subscription. This is the only way to get access to Stadia right now and for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd there's a reason for that: It's the only use case that feels finished. Google Stadia arrives with a litany of missing features, especially on PC and phones. As such, the Chromecast is the only device that supports 4K streaming at release, as well as 5.1 surround sound and the wireless Stadia controller. Those features won't hit other platforms until 2020.\n\n[ PC World ]\n\nStadia's launch day is Tuesday… sort of. Really, consider this the start of Stadia's early-access beta period. Because Google's big promises haven't arrived, and at the price of the Stadia's Founder's Edition, I can't recommend anyone jump onboard at the moment. Google's experimental game streaming service, Stadia, launches without many of its promised features, and just a handful of games. It works, but there's not much incentive to buy in.\n\n[ CNET ]\n\nDespite The Monthly Fee, You're Still Buying — Not Renting — Games\n\nWhile you've probably heard predictions that Google's Stadia will be the \"Netflix of games,\" it turns out the analogy only goes so far. While Google intends to eventually have a back catalog of free games included for your $10 monthly fee, Stadia is not primarily a subscription service. The subscription only includes a single game as of today — Destiny 2. Primarily, Google tells us you should expect to buy, not rent cloud games for the same retail prices you'd find on other platforms like PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam.\n\n[ The Verge ]\n\nEven when Stadia is at its best though, there's a catch: You will never own your Stadia games. You will never have local copies on your hardware, which means you have access to your games (games you paid for) only as long as they stay in the Stadia library. If Google decides to remove certain titles, or shutter the service entirely (it happens, pretty often in fact), the games you paid for will be gone.\n\n[ Wired ]\n\nStadia's Current Roster Of Games Isn't Very Impressive\n\nStadia's 22 launch titles are uninspiring. They include: Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2, Destiny 2: The Collection, Farming Simulator 2019, Final Fantasy XV, Football Manager 2020, Grid 2019, Gylt, Just Dance 2020, Kine, Metro Exodus, Mortal Kombat 11, NBA 2K20, Rage 2, Red Dead Redemption 2, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Samurai Shodown, Thumper, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2013, Trials Rising, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. About half came out this year, one is a Stadia exclusive (Gylt), and almost all of them are available on other platforms.\n\n[ Inverse ]\n\nProvided You Have A Solid Internet Connection, The Streaming Quality Seems To Be Mostly Excellent\n\nStadia's performance is promising at worst, and impressive at best. Sitting in my bedroom, controller in hand, streaming Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4K resolution, HDR color and 5.1 surround sound without a console anywhere in sight, I couldn't help but feel a little astounded. If this is the future of gaming, I could get used to it, at least on some level.\n\n[ Tom's Guide ]\n\nThe bulk of my time on the Stadia was spent with the system in traditional TV mode. That means the Stadia controller connecting to Google's servers over wifi, and a Chromecast Ultra plugged into the back of my TV doing the same. For \"best performance\", Google recommends wiring the Chromecast up to a LAN, but doing so felt like overkill. Only once did I experience anything that looked like lag (when sending a picture message to my partner); every other time, it was perfect.\n\n[ The Guardian ]\n\nI have very fast internet connection at home, so the games were really crisp and fluid most of the time. It felt, generally, like I was playing on a regular console. But every now and again, I'd be reminded I was streaming when the graphics in a game dropped to a lower quality, or if the game just unexpectedly quit. That doesn't happen often on an Xbox or a PS4, and it's bad news if you're trying to finish a level or fight someone in a multiplayer game.\n\n[ CNBC]\n\nThe Stadia Controller Is Only Necessary For Playing On A TV, But It's Very Comfortable\n\nGoogle's gone way over the top comparing the controller to a chef's knife, but it's an excellent controller, seriously. It feels something like a blend of the XBox One controller and Nintendo Switch pro controller, with smooth analog triggers, solid rumble haptics, crisp analog sticks and d-pad. Playing with it feels effortless. I like how the Stadia button turns the platform on, and a solid rumble-throb kicks in to let you know the service has connected.\n\n[ CNET ]\n\nThe controller is really comfortable to hold over long periods of time and has good battery life. That's important, since it's the only way to control the games you're playing. The button layout is different, but it was just as comfortable and really similar to the Nintendo Switch Pro controller. Setup between devices was usually pretty easy. I just turned the controller on and plugged it into either the Pixel 3a or computer I was using. Google says the controller will eventually work wirelessly with phones as it does with the Chromecast Ultra.\n\n[ CNBC ]\n\nTL;DR\n\nThere's no reason anyone should buy into Stadia right now. Google has made sure of that, partly by underdelivering at launch and partly with a pricing scheme that sees you paying three times (for hardware, for the service, for games) just to be an early adopter.\n\n[ The Verge ]\n\nIs Google Stadia the future? That's really two questions, I guess. First, \"Is streaming the future of gaming?\" Possibly. It's convenient, and even exciting at times. But if you're asking whether Stadia is the platform to get us there? I have my doubts.\n\n[ PC World ]\n\nGame streaming is finally viable, and Stadia is leading the charge — but with this launch, it's turning out to be more of a stroll. Hey, at least we're getting there.\n\n[ Engadget ]\n\nIf you're on the fence about investing $129 in an unproven service, you're not alone. The Premiere Edition is basically for true believers who don't mind dropping serious money on what amounts to a pay-to-play beta test. When February rolls around and those free trials are offered, you should give it a shot. You might be surprised.\n\n[ Wired ]\n\nDallas Robinson is a freelance writer living in Minneapolis\n\nWant more stories like this?\n\nEvery day we send an email with the top stories from Digg.\n\nSubscribe\nREINDEER GAMES\n\n'Why Don't You Go Fight For The Reindeer?'\n\n1 digg delacortereview.org Long Reads World\n\nScandinavia's Sami have been herding reindeer for generations.

Retherford/SWRI)\n\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed seem to be real.\n\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes emanating from Europa, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath its ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor directly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\n\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system. But the third — liquid water — is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\n\nRelated: Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images\n\nPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life.\n\nThe researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May 2017. On one of those nights — April 26, 2016 — they got a strong signal of water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared light.\n\nAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff — about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons), according to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric tons, of water).\n\nThe researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be coming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's shell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted to result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules from Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such stripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be noted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new paper, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nMultiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For example, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic hydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by radiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the density of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\n\nAnd it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In that regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the south pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus, which is generated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\n\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct detection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits of our detection method,\" Paganini said.\n\nPlumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to astrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially habitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic probes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just that, if everything works out just right.\n\nNASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close on dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for spots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future. Clipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys, if mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years — or if they just get really lucky.\n\nNASA Europa Mission Could Potentially Spot Signs of Alien Life\nPhotos: Europa, Mysterious Icy Moon of Jupiter\nKeck Observatory: Twin Telescopes on Mauna Kea\n\nMike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \" Out There\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), is out now.

As a defense, the Browns had 11 hits on Mason Rudolph (well, 12 if you count the helmet hit). 8 of those hits came from the defensive line. 5 of those hits were from two players facing suspension now (2 for Larry Ogunjobi, 3 for Myles Garrett).\nOgunjobi and Garrett have been playing a ton of snaps all season. Since Olivier Vernon’s injury a couple of weeks ago, Chad Thomas has filled in and played way above my expectations (including logging another sack this week and almost having an interception). The problem is that Cleveland really doesn’t have a long-term option to replace those snaps in the starting lineup.\nIdeally, Vernon would come back from his knee injury this week, but when he’ll return is still a question mark. Is veteran Chris Smith going to get most of Garrett ’s snaps (actually, Thomas would shift over)? Smith is good for depth, but as a starter, that’s a hefty downgrade. The same goes for Ogunjobi up front. Sheldon Richardson is the only starter in tact right now; I’d expect some works for this week’s game in Miami.\n\nLinebacker\n\nPos Player Plays % Stats\nPos Player Plays % Stats\nLB Joe Schobert 74 100% 7 tackles, 3 assists (10 combined). 1 sack, 2 TFL, 2 QH, 2 INT, 4 passes defended.\nLB Mack Wilson 74 100% 1 tackle, 4 assists (5 combined). 1 pass defended.\nLB Sione Takitaki 6 8% No stats registered.\n\nThis was an amazing game for Joe Schobert, who filled up the stat sheet in impressive fashion. Take a look at what PFF said about his performance:\n\nThe #Browns highest-graded player* on defense vs. #Steelers was Joe Schobert. He posted an elite 93.2 defensive grade and 91.4 coverage grade. He had two INTs and a PBU in coverage, allowing a passer rating of just 22.4\n*min. 25 snaps pic.twitter.com/PQqbN51wBW\n\n— PFF CLE Browns (@PFF_Browns) November 15, 2019\n\nSione Takitaki played 6 snaps on defense, staying ahead of Adarius Taylor on the depth chart.\n\nCornerback\n\nPos Player Plays % Stats\nPos Player Plays % Stats\nCB Denzel Ward 74 100% 4 tackles (4 combined). 1 pass defended.\nCB Greedy Williams 73 99% 6 tackles, 1 assist (7 combined). 1 TFL.\nCB T.J. Carrie 63 85% 1 tackle (1 combined).\nCB Tavierre Thomas 1 1% No stats registered.\n\nHe may not have been flagged a lot, so the stat sheet won’t show it, but this was a pretty rough game for Greedy Williams. The Steelers had no offensive players (with experience) left, so they wisely took the approach of chucking the ball down the sideline and hoping for a catch or interference. Williams was flagged once for it, but was borderline on a few other plays, and against better receivers, would have allowed the big catches. He needs to get his head snapped around more on those plays to locate the ball. On the bright side, his run defense has been great.\n\n#Browns Greedy Williams has been solid in run support and tackling so far this season. He averages one miss for every 22 tackle attempts (T-15th) and is top-20 in both run defense (75.5) and tackling grade (77.4) among 127 qualifying CBs pic.twitter.com/I8NWz4blQC\n\n— PFF CLE Browns (@PFF_Browns) November 16, 2019\n\nDenzel Ward is still waiting for his first interception of the year. He almost had one against Pittsburgh, but the overthrown pass went off his hands.\n\nSafety\n\nPos Player Plays % Stats\nPos Player Plays % Stats\nS Damarious Randall 43 58% 1 tackle (1 combined).\nS Juston Burris 42 57% 4 tackles, 1 assist (5 combined). 1 sack, 1 QH, 1 INT, 1 pass defended, 1 FF.\nS Morgan Burnett 35 47% 3 tackles, 2 assists (5 combined). 1 TFL, 1 INT, 2 passes defended.\nS Sheldrick Redwine 33 45% 1 tackle (1 combined).\n\nThe safety depth was tested against the Steelers, as Damarious Randall was ejected mid-way through the game for a hit to the head, and Morgan Burnett was lost to a season-ending Achilles’ injury. Safety depth has been shaky all season due to injury, and whatever that Jermaine Whitehead experiment was.\nJuston Burris and Sheldrick Redwine both stepped up to the plate and did a good job. But that was against Mason Rudolph, a below average quarterback. Fortunately, Randall will be back, and Burnett was never viewed as a long-term answer at strong safety. I don’t know what direction Steve Wilks will go at strong safety, but I like the way Burris has played when given opportunities. When Eric Murray returns from injury, it’ll probably be his starting job the rest of the way.\n\nMore From Dawgs By Nature\n\nDaily Dawg Chow (11/20/19)\nSteelers’ Mike Tomlin admits club’s role in Helmetgate\nThe Dawgs By Nature Browns FanShop\nNFL Power Rankings: Browns edging closer to Steelers heading into Week 12\nBrowns place Morgan Burnett on injured reserve\nPlayoff Watch 2.0 – Where do the Browns stand?\n\nMost Read\n\nSteelers’ Mike Tomlin admits club’s role in Helmetgate Longtime Pittsburgh head coach takes partial responsibility in melee\nDaily Dawg Chow (11/19/19) More of the latest Browns news and notes from around the web in today’s dose of the Daily Dawg Chow.\nPlayoff Watch 2.0 – Where do the Browns stand?

Zoghlin, Carlineo’s attorney, told The Hill in a statement that her client did not intend to cause harm to Omar and did not make plans to do so.\n\n“Pat Carlineo is passionate about his political beliefs and his right to express them,” she said in an email. “He has taken responsibility for using threatening and inappropriate language to express those beliefs in this instance.”\n\nCarlineo was arrested in April for a March 21 phone call he reportedly made to Omar’s office, in which he said he’d put a “bullet in her f---ing skull.”\n\nThe office referred the call to U.S. Capitol Police, who worked with the FBI to investigate. When Carlineo was approached, he told police he supported Trump and hates radical Muslims in government.\n\nRep.

Credit... Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times\n\nBy Ana Swanson\n\n阅读简体中文版 閱讀繁體中文版\n\nWhen President Trump’s advisers suggested that Beijing resume buying around $20 billion in American farm products as part of a trade deal, Mr. Trump wasn’t satisfied. In a dramatic public retelling in the Cabinet Room, he said he pressed his team to more than triple that figure, then trimmed that a little and asked for up to $50 billion in annual purchases.\n\n“My people had $20 billion done,” Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21 cabinet meeting. “And I said, ‘I want more.’ They said, ‘The farmers can’t handle it.’ I said, ‘Tell them to buy larger tractors. It’s very simple.’” The cabinet members gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.\n\nMr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks with China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has alternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of the insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even bigger threats should China not accede to his terms.\n\nBut more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history, Mr. Trump’s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for. Instead, the president’s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even harder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic uncertainty across the globe.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had reached a “historic” Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has proved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an agreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr. Trump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal and if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be removed.\n\n“We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,” Mr. Trump said on Nov. 8. “I like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much more than I do, but we could have a deal.”\n\nA prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows him to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic criticism that he is caving to Beijing.\n\nBut businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged financial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms that rely on robust trade flows between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nExecutives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some hiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by unforeseen policies, and conserve cash.\n\nThe uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly manufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while Germany has barely avoided falling into recession.\n\n“It’s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth,” John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. “The uncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we’re experiencing today.”\n\nMr. Trump’s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected similar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he might leave some trading partners behind.\n\nThe president says his approach has created leverage — and in some cases, he is right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada, Japan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed to. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, to the negotiating table.\n\nBut that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a close. Mr. Trump’s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people familiar with Chinese trade policy said.\n\nEswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president’s “mercurial temperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team” had complicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. “By hyping up expectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes the prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and volatile,” he said.\n\nThe two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of domestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take place in United States “farm country,” but the Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\n\nWithout a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure to get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president’s unpredictable behavior — as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n\nMr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and that the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China has long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in China.\n\nBut they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack of resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the administration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and leaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks.\n\nThe roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect — or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would remain.\n\n“It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,” said Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for companies. “It really doesn’t fit well with the world of global supply chains. And we’re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that. ”\n\nEven Mr. Trump’s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration with his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the president doesn’t want the show to end.\n\nIn a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau, said farmers faced “near-unprecedented economic uncertainty and hardship” stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and other key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible, saying “time is running out for many in agriculture.”\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested — larger purchases “than any time in our history, by far” — into the actual text of a trade agreement.\n\nWhile China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it favors American products over other countries’, as well as agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\n\nEven if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\n\nMr. Trump’s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies will be removed if a deal is reached.\n\nThe president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval Office with Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an increase in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back any levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been under pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United States.\n\n“Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?” He Jianxiong, the former executive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a Nov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.\n\nKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nSite Index\n\nGo to Home Page »\nnews\n\nhome page\nworld\nU.S.\npolitics\nElection 2020\nNew York\nbusiness\ntech\nscience\nclimate\nsports\nobituaries\nthe upshot\nEspañol\n中文网\ntoday's paper\ncorrections\n\nopinion\n\ntoday's opinion\nop-ed columnists\neditorials\nop-ed Contributors\nletters\nsunday review\nvideo: opinion\n\narts\n\ntoday's arts\nart & design\nbooks\ndance\nmovies\nmusic\nPop Culture\ntelevision\ntheater\nwatching\nvideo: arts\n\nliving\n\nautomobiles\nCooking\ncrossword\neducation\nfood\nhealth\njobs\nmagazine\nparenting\nreal estate\nstyle\nt magazine\ntravel\nlove\n\nlistings & more\n\nReader Center\nWirecutter\nLive Events\nThe Learning Network\ntools & services\nN.Y.C. events guide\nmultimedia\nphotography\nvideo\nNewsletters\nNYT store\ntimes journeys\nmanage my account\n\nnews\n\nhome page\nworld\nU.S.\npolitics\nElection 2020\nNew York\nbusiness\ntech\nscience\nclimate\nsports\nobituaries\nthe upshot\nEspañol\n中文网\ntoday's paper\ncorrections\n\nopinion\n\ntoday's opinion\nop-ed columnists\neditorials\nop-ed Contributors\nletters\nsunday review\nvideo: opinion\n\narts\n\ntoday's arts\nart & design\nbooks\ndance\nmovies\nmusic\nPop Culture\ntelevision\ntheater\nwatching\nvideo: arts\n\nliving\n\nautomobiles\nCooking\ncrossword\neducation\nfood\nhealth\njobs\nmagazine\nparenting\nreal estate\nstyle\nt magazine\ntravel\nlove\n\nmore\n\nReader Center\nWirecutter\nLive Events\nThe Learning Network\ntools & services\nN.Y.C. events guide\nmultimedia\nphotography\nvideo\nNewsletters\nNYT store\ntimes journeys\nmanage my account\n\nSubscribe\n\nhome delivery\ndigital subscriptions\nCrossword\nCooking\n\nemail newsletters\ncorporate subscriptions\neducation rate\n\nmobile applications\nreplica edition\nEspañol\n中文网\n\nSite Information Navigation\n\n© 2019 The New York Times Company\n\nContact Us\nWork with us\nAdvertise\nT Brand Studio\nYour Ad Choices\nPrivacy\nTerms of Service\nTerms of Sale\nSite Map\nHelp\nSubscriptions"

We're On It,' and Twitter asks, Are you guys OK?\n\nLisa Kaczke and Trevor J. Mitchell Sioux Falls Argus Leader\nPublished 10:02 AM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. – People across the nation are talking about it: South Dakota is on meth.\n\nThe buzz on both national news and social media focused on a new anti-drug ad campaign led by Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nThe tagline? \"Meth. We're on it.\"\n\nNoem launched the campaign to bring awareness to the meth epidemic in South Dakota, and the ad going viral on its first day shows that it's already a success.\n\n\"The mission of the campaign is to raise awareness – to get people talking about how they can be part of the solution and not just the problem,\" Noem told the Argus Leader Monday afternoon. \"It is working.\"\n\n'Meth. We're On It.': South Dakota spends $449K on new anti-meth ad campaign\n\nSouth Dakota's meth crisis is \"growing at an alarming rate\" and affects every community in the state, Noem said in the campaign's public service announcement.\n\n\"This is our problem, and together, we need to get on it,\" Noem said.\n\nNoem called the new campaign a \"bold, innovative effort like the nation has never before seen.\"\n\nIn the coming weeks, South Dakotans will see the campaign in various media from TV to billboards to radio spots. The goal is to reach everyone in the state and educate them on signs of addiction, resources available to fight addiction and strategies to engage communities in recovery, Noem said.\n\nThe state's Department of Social Services paid a Minnesota ad agency just short of $449,000 this fall for their work on the campaign, according to the state's finances website.\n\n\"I am confident South Dakota can lead the country in this effort and demonstrate ways we can aggressively combat addiction and spark opportunities for recovery,\" Noem said.\n\nTwitter seemed a bit confused by the campaign:\n\nPublished 10:02 AM EST Nov 19, 2019\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n© Copyright Gannett 2018"

Islam sudah sempurna secara aqidah mau pun fiqih. Islam sudah sempurna sebelum Nabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat Nabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\n\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna dan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi, ngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini belum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\n\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syi’ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan. Pendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja. Pendukung Muawiyah dan yg netral disebut Sunni.\n\nSetelah pecah itulah jalan sendiri2.\n\nImam Ja’far Ash Shadiq yg merupakan guru dari Imam Malik dan Imam Abu Hañifah membentuk Mazhab Ja’fari. Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafi’ie membentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam Syafi’ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafi’ie. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan murid.\n\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni bikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih Bukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di Rijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama Mu’awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\n\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan orang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa diajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\n\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih dan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\n\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam. Pelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.⁠⁠\n\nPenghinaan terhadap Istri dan Sahabat Nabi\n\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti ‘Aisyah ra dan menghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra, Usman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat. Harusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\n\nSyi’ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib dan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video Yasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan kemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara London dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke Indonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya untuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\n\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib. Bahkan Imam tertinggi Syi’ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena mengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\n\nAhmadinejad: Siapa Menghina Sahabat Rasulullah Sekutu Musuh Islam\n\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, “Dari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang siapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah seorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam. Ia tidak lebih hanyalah kaki tangan dan alat mainan musuh-musuh asing.”\n\nhttp://www.ipabionline.com/2013/02/ahmadinejad-siapa-menghina-sahabat.html#ixzz2PpyAj3AN\n\nKhamenei: Haram Menghina Istri Nabi dan Simbol Ahlusunah\n\nhttp://syiahali.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/fatwa-para-ulama-larangan-mencaci-para-sahabat/\n\nFatwa Para Ulama Syi’ah Larangan Mencaci Para Sahabat\n\nhttp://www.shia-explained.com/my/archives/2364\n\nSekarang kita lihat asal muasal penghinaan terhadap istri dan sahabat Nabi.\n\nSaya dulu merasa kehidupan semua sahabat rukun dan damai. Itu benar di zaman Nabi. Saat Nabi wafat, timbul perdebatan siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin ummat Islam sebagai Nabi. Kaum Syi’ah umumnya berpendapat Ali berhak menjadi Khalifah. Sementara mayoritas sahabat mengangkat Abu Bakar ra sebagai Khalifah. Suka tidak suka, semua sahabat membai’at Abu Bakar sebagai Khalifah. Termasuk Ali.\n\nSaat Ali jadi khalifah, Siti ‘Aisyah memberontak dalam perang yang disebut Perang Jamal yang menewaskan 17.000 orang. Saat Mu’awiyah berontak dalam perang Siffin pun ada 70.000 Muslim yang tewas. Dari pihak Ali 25.000 orang yang tewas. Dari pihak Mu’awiyah, 45.000 orang yang tewas.\n\nNah kalau para sahabat ini saling bunuh dalam Perang Jamal dan Perang Siffin, tentu diawali dengan perang lisan dan juga tulisan. Saling hina. Bisa jadi tulisan2 yang mengina sampai ke kita hingga sekarang. Ini mirip saat Pilpres 2014 antara Jokowi melawan Prabowo di mana masing2 pengikut menghina yang lain. Bahkan Jokowi difitnah sebagai kafir sehingga keluarlah foto2 Jokowi sedang sholat.\n\nItulah asal muasal penghinaan istri dan sahabat Nabi. Itu satu lembaran hitam sejarah yang harusnya kita tutup. Menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi yg dilakukan sebagian kaum Syi’ah dan menghina orang tua Nabi yg dilakukan Wahabi itu dosa besar. Cuma kalau taubat dan pemimpinnya mengharamkannya, ya selesai. Allah Maha Pengampun.\n\nManusia itu sifatnya salah dan lupa. Sebaik2 orang salah adalah orang yang taubat. Nabi Adam dan Nabi Yunus pun pernah salah, tapi begitu tobat, diampuni oleh Allah. Begitu. Makanya KH Quraish Shihab saat menilai Syi’ah itu sesat atau lurus, beliau juga melihat perkembangan mereka. Yang tobat dan mengharamkan penghinaan thd sahabat ya otomatis tidak sesat. Sebaliknya yang tetap menghina, ini sesat.\n\nPenghinaan pun macam-macam tingkatnya. Dari sekedar kritik yang santun, hingga penghinaan yang amat amat keji. Kitabnya pun ada. Sahabat yang dihina pun macam-macam. Dari sahabat Abu Bakar ra dan Umar bin Khoththob yang namanya dijamin Nabi masuk surga, hingga Mu’awiyah yang masuk Islam setelah Futuh Mekkah da anaknya Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, Sayyidina Husein ra.\n\nMenghina Siti Aisyah ra, Abu Bakar ra, dan Umar bin Khoththob ra tidak dibenarkan apa pun alasannya. Sesat. Sebaliknya menyatakan bahwa Mu’awiyah berontak terhadap Khalifah Ali atau Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, itu sekedar kritik berdasarkan fakta sejarah. Namun kaum Sunni tetap menjaga lisan mereka untuk tidak mengutuk atau menghina Mu’awiyah dan Yazid. Urusan mereka ada di tangan Allah.\n\nIklan\n\nShare this:\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nCetak\nSurat elektronik\nLagi\n\nLinkedIn\nTumblr\nReddit\nPinterest\n\nSukai ini:\n\nSuka Memuat...\n\nTerkait\n\nFiled under: Syi'ah |\n\n« Macam2 Syi’ah Ghulat yang Kafir Muslim Sunni Punya 12.000 Masjid di Iran »\n\nTinggalkan Balasan Batalkan balasan\n\nKetikkan komentar di sini...\n\nPlease log in using one of these methods to post your comment:\n\nSurel (wajib) (Alamat takkan pernah dipublikasikan)\nNama (wajib)\nSitus Web\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Unlike the original two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, Star Trek Beyond was directed by Justin Lin; 2009’s Star Trek and 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness were directed by J.J. Abrams. Abrams was a producer on Star Trek Beyond, and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth film.\n\nThis will be Hawley’s second film\n\nThe fourth Star Trek film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris Hemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George Kirk, the father of Chris Pine’s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years is a long time, and actors’ schedules shift. It’s unclear whether Hawley’s film is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return — both Hemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Wrap’s report today claims that Pine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn’t mention Hemsworth.\n\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth Trek film, according to The Wrap, so it’s possible Paramount is still deciding on a direction. As if things weren’t murky enough, Deadline reports that Paramount is also still working on a second, R-rated Star Trek spin-off from Quentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017.\n\nThe fourth Star Trek movie will be Hawley’s second film. Lucy in the Sky, his debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing with life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics — and flopped at the box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nNo release date for the fourth Star Trek film has yet been announced.\n\nNext Up In Tech\n\nGood Deals\n\nHere’s when Black Friday deals start at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more Don’t go into Black Friday without a strategy\nHere are the best Black Friday smart speaker deals Alexa, find me deals\n\nMore in Good Deals\n\nVerge3.0_Logomark_Color_1\n\nSign up for the newsletter Command Line\n\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\n\nEmail (required)\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nSubscribe\n\nLoading comments...\n\nChorus\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nGDPR Commitment\nCommunications Preferences\n\nContact\nTip Us\nCommunity Guidelines\nAbout\nEthics Statement\n\nAll Systems Operational Check out our status page for more details.\nVox Media\n\nVox Media\n\nVox Media logo.

Volker said he had no knowledge of any efforts to urge Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nMorrison was the third witness testifying Tuesday who listened in on President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he wasn't concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would be \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.\n\nRepublicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which he raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman, who is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona Hill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\n\nTrump Impeachment Inquiry More\n\nWatch live: Sondland testifies about Ukraine at pivotal impeachment hearing\nKey moments from Kurt Volker's and Tim Morrison's testimony\n7 key moments from Tuesday's first impeachment hearing\nVolker says he didn't realize link between Ukraine investigations and Bidens\nWhite House aides testify about \"unusual,\" \"improper\" Ukraine call at hearing\n\nMore in Trump Impeachment Inquiry\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\n\"My fears have been realized\"\n\nDay 3, Part 10: Tim Morrison's opening statement\n\nMorrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My fears have been realized.\"\n\nHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the illegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day that the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\" mutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n\n2. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\n\nVolker: Allegations against Biden are \"not credible\"\n\n\"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening statement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019.\"\n\nVolker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate Ukrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he heard the July 25 call.\n\n\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into Burisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how Ukrainian officials could be confused.\n\n3. \"Not some irregular channel\"\n\nVolker insists he worked through \"official\" Ukraine channel, \"cringes\" at \"three amigos\" references\n\nVolker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been portrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were known as the \"Three Amigos.\"\n\nVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe when I hear it.\"\n\n4. Questioning Vindman's judgment\n\nMorrison discusses concerns about Vindman's judgment\n\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC about Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his predecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the question was outside the scope of his testimony.\n\nMorrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had raised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect Vindman denied earlier in the day.\n\nMorrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about concerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal counsel.\n\n\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've expected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his testimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National Security Adviser John Bolton — Morrison's supervisor — to go straight to the NSC legal counsel with his concerns.\n\nMorrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion from some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n\n5. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\n\nVolker says there was nothing unusual about hold on aid\n\n\"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the delay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\n\nVolker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of August, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\n\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said. \"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that same time.\"\n\n6. \"The Gordon problem\"\n\nTim Morrison on \"the Gordon problem\"\n\nMorrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from Sondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in forming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n\n7. \"The Giuliani problem\"\n\nVolker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the new Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call made him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\n\"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Volker said.\n\nFirst published on November 20, 2019 / 1:07 AM\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

In a new case study out Monday, they detail how the man came down with a rare form of allergy to the bird feathers that filled his new duvet and pillows.\n\nAccording to the study, published in BMJ Case Reports, the 43-year-old man had suffered months of dizziness, fatigue, and breathlessness by the time he visited his local doctor in November 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, his doctor assumed he had a lower respiratory tract infection, like bronchitis, and his symptoms did improve soon after. But by December, they worsened, to the point where he could no longer walk to the next room in his house without feeling out of breath. His doctor referred him to an urgent respiratory care clinic and sought out advice from one of the study authors, Owen Dempsey, a chest doctor at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n\n“Their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion—think Donald Trump rather than Barack Obama”\n\nDempsey talked with the man over the phone, trying to zero in any potential causes for his symptoms. And once the man mentioned that he and his wife had recently switched from synthetic bedding to a feather duvet and feather pillows, Dempsey quickly came up with a preliminary diagnosis that was later confirmed by lab testing: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or HP.\n\nThe man had a particular form of HP that tends to strike people who raise or work closely with birds, which has earned it the nickname of “ bird fancier’s lung. ” But in cases where people have gotten HP simply from being exposed to feather bedding, it’s instead been dubbed “ feather duvet lung. ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In some individuals that meet proteins from bird droppings or dust from their feathers, their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion—think Donald Trump rather than Barack Obama,” Dempsey told Gizmodo by email.\n\nE-Cigarettes Don't Have to Be Tainted to Send You to the Hospital, UK Case Shows\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of people in the U.S. have become acutely sick and have even died due to\n\nRead more\nAdvertisement\n\nHP, as Gizmodo very recently explained, is a complex and rare condition. It involves different antibodies than the ones that cause a typical food or skin allergy. That means it isn’t detectable through a standard allergy test, nor do people react instantaneously when they’re exposed to their trigger. It’s also not clear why any one person develops HP, since many of us can carry these specific antibodies to a trigger but never become sick.\n\n“Most people of course don’t get this, and it depends on how their immune system is primed and is affected by their genetics,” Dempsey said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Dempsey quickly suspected feather duvet lung, though, he told the man to remove the bedding from his home the very first time they spoke. And within days, he began to improve. Subsequent treatment with steroids seemed to speed up his recovery, though Dempsey noted there’s no definitive evidence that steroids will help with HP. Regardless, by the time he was weaned off treatment a year later, he was back to normal.\n\n“It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,” the man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the case report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it’s likely that more people contract feather duvet lung than is documented, given how hard it is to diagnose, it’s not something you should be worried about if you’ve been sleeping contently under a down-filled duvet with no issues.\n\n“Hold onto your feather bedding, but if you do get chest symptoms, e.g. breathlessness or cough, mention it to your health care professional,” Dempsey said. “Most don’t think about it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShare This Story\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nScientists Have Created a Vaccine for Cat Allergies, but You Can't Have It Yet\n\nThe First Peanut Allergy Drug Might Be Approved Soon—but Not Without Controversy\n\nWhy Do We Get Allergies?\n\nAbout the author\n\nEd Cara\nEd Cara\n\nScience writer at Gizmodo and pug aficionado elsewhere\n\nEmail Twitter Posts\nShare\nTweet"

        "articleBody": "Thousands of teachers pack Indiana Statehouse for protest\n\nWelcome to The Detroit News’s EUROPEAN UNION EXPERIENCE\n\nLearn More\n\nThousands of teachers pack Indiana Statehouse for protest\n\nTom Davies Associated Press\nPublished 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nIndianapolis – Several thousand teachers wearing red surrounded the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday to call for better pay and more respect from the Republican-dominated state government in a protest that closed more than half of the state’s school districts for the day.\n\nThe union-organized rally represented Indiana’s biggest such teacher protest amid a wave of educator activism across the country over the past two years.\n\nIndiana teachers wearing red have carry signs as they hold rally at the Statehouse in Indianapolis, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, calling for further increasing teacher pay in the biggest such protest in the state amid a wave of educator activism across the country.\nMichael Conroy, AP\n\nTeachers chanted, “Fund our schools,” and “Put kids first,” as hundreds of them lined entrances to the Statehouse, many holding handmade signs with sayings such as, “Less Money on Testing, More Money on Students.” Teachers with marching band instruments played “We’re Not Gonna Take It” from the Statehouse steps.\n\nHigh school math teacher Angela Cooper said she and more than 40 fellow teachers from the Gibson Southern schools near Evansville left about 4:30 a.m. for the rally. She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to leave for other jobs.\n\n“We need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,” Cooper said. “They start in the classroom but then they leave because they aren’t paid enough.”\n\nIndiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand teachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct money from the state’s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\n“The crisis is now, and we need action now,” Gambill said to cheers from the crowd. “The issue is funding, and the state has the money.”\n\nNearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers unions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of their 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than 15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least 5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency didn’t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have avoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings. They seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers who used sick days to rally. However, they said they don’t expect to take action on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\n\nOther teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.\n\nWhile some Indiana protesters chanted, “Red for Ed,” in a Statehouse hallway, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state budget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by 2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted the plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\n\nBosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state’s new ILEARN standardized exam taken last spring – one of the top concerns of the teachers unions.\n\n“We get that you’re frustrated,” Bosma said. “We get that you are concerned about issues.”\n\nTeachers didn’t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he was keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of the Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward Holcomb’s 2016 election campaign.\n\nThe governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in February to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\n\nEducation advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was needed to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states. Republican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study showing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since 2002.\n\nMcCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the state’s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they weren’t “asking for the moon.”\n\n“What a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,” she said.\n\nJoel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana’s Richmond High School, said politicians have “vilified” educators.\n\n“They think they know better about education than us,” he said. “They don’t trust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when we’re in the classroom.”\n\nPublished 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n© The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper"

        "articleBody": "Cannabis Use Disorder is Rising in U.S. States Where Weed is Legal\n\nWed, Nov 20, 2019\nSign In Subscribe\nSearch\n\nU.S.\nWorld\nBusiness\nTech & Science\nCulture\nNewsgeek\nSports\nHealth\nOpinion\nVantage\n\nHealth\n\nCannabis Use Disorder is Rising in U.S. States Where Weed is Legal\n\nBy Kashmira Gander On 11/13/19 at 4:00 PM EST\nShare\nHealth Marijuana Cannabis Weed\n\nRates of cannabis use disorder have risen in U.S. states where the drug has been legalized, including among children and teenagers, according to a study.\n\nThe authors of the research published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry argued that while the policies have provided \"important social benefits, particularly around issues of equity in criminal justice,\" the climb in conditions like cannabis use disorder are \"a potential public health concern.\"\n\nTo uncover the effects of the changes, researchers looked at surveys completed by 505,796 people between 2008 to 2016. Of the total participants who filled in The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in those years, just over half were female, 77 percent were aged 26 or above, 65 percent were white, 11.9 percent were black, 15.36 percent Hispanic, and 7.3 of another race or ethnicity.\n\nThe team looked at data on states where cannabis had been legalized by 2016— Colorado,Washington, Alaska, and Oregon— and noted if and how often respondents used marijuana in the past month, and whether they had cannabis use disorder before a nd after the laws were enacted.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nDangers of Vaping: Facts and Statistics on Health Risks of E-Cigarettes\nCannabis Could Ease Symptoms of Depression in PTSD Patients\nThese Are the Industries Where Staff Are Most Likely to Smoke Weed\n\nCannabis use disorder is where a person's use of the drug negatively affects their life over the course of 12 months. They might struggle to cut down, use so much it makes it hard to work or fulfil responsibilities in the home, and spend a lot of time taking the drug and recovering from its effects.\n\nIn adults aged 26 or older, the number who said they had used cannabis in the past month rose by 23 percent when compared with states where recreational use isn't allowed. Problematic cannabis use rose by 37 percent, from 0.90 percent to 1.23 percent, after recreational marijuana legalization.\n\nThe number of respondents aged between 12 to 17-years-old who had cannabis use disorder rose \"slightly\" by 25 percent compared with those in the same group in other states, from 2.18 percent to 2.72 percent, the authors wrote.\n\nBut among participants aged between 18 to 25-years-old, the rates of cannabis use in the past month, frequency and cannabis use disorder didn't change.\n\nA stock image of a woman holding a joint. Researchers have looked at the relationship between legalisation and problematic use of the drug. Getty\n\nMarijuana for recreational use has been legalized in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Using weed occasionally is not thought to cause substantial problems, the authors said. But long-term, heavy use is linked to physical and psychological problems, as well as lower educational attainment, decline in social class, unemployment, and motor vehicle crashes, they wrote.\n\nSenior author Dr. Silvia S. Martins, associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, commented: \"Cannabis use disorder in adolescence is associated with long-term adverse health, economic and social consequences.\n\nNeil Young's Plan to Vote Against Trump Suffers Setback Over Marijuana Use\nRead more\n\n\"Given our findings on problematic use across age groups, legalization efforts should coincide with prevention and treatment. The general public should be informed about both benefits and potential harms of marijuana products to make informed decisions,\" Martins said.\n\nIan Hamilton, an expert in drug use and mental health at the Department of Health Sciences at the U.K.'s University of York who did not work on the study, told Newsweek: \"Although the researchers found that regular use increased by only a few percent following the policy change this could equate to a large proportion of the population given the popularity of cannabis. Even a small percentage increase in regular cannabis users can increase the risk of developing problems like cannabis dependence which services would be unlikely to have the capacity to support.\"\n\nThis graphic, provided by Statista, shows the U.S. states where recreational marijuana has been legalized.\n\nU.S. states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational and/or medical use. Statista\n\nHowever, he pointed out it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from observational studies such as this one. The researchers weren't, for instance, able to collect any data about the strength or potency of the cannabis used, \"so it might be that some people were using low potency cannabis frequently which wouldn't create the same degree of risk as those using high potency cannabis regularly,\" Hamilton argued.\n\nHamilton urged people to be cautious of believing assertions made by suppliers and manufacturers related to cannabis, such as unevidenced claims about health benefits, and even basic information on strength.\n\n\"Although cannabis is less harmful than many other drugs it is not completely risk free, part of the problem is we are still unable to predict who is at risk of developing problems until they are exposed to the drug, by which time it is often too late,\" Hamilton said.\n\nBut he said the results also don't mean cannabis shouldn't be legalized, rather \"that for the small proportion of users who develop problems support services need to be adequately funded and available, something other states and countries should factor in when thinking of changing their cannabis policies.\"\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing, Submit Correction or view Editorial Guidelines\nCannabis Use Disorder is Rising in U.S. States Where Weed is Legal | Health\nSign up for our Newsletter\nSign up\nUpdate your preferences »\nChoose a Membership That's Perfect for You!\n\nPrint & Digital\n\nWeekly magazine, delivered\nDaily Newsletter\nWebsite access\n\nSubscribe\n\nPrint Only\n\nWeekly magazine, delivered\nDaily Newsletter\nWebsite access\n\nSubscribe\n\nDigital Only\n\nFree access to 40+ digital editions\nWebsite access\nDaily Newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\n© 2019 Newsweek\n\nAbout Us\nCorrections\nContact Us\nEditorial Guidelines\nAdvertise\nCopyright\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms of Sale\nArchive\nAnnouncements\n\nConsent preferences\nEditions:\n\nU.S. Edition\n日本\n한국\nPakistan\nPolska\nRomânia"

        "articleBody": "Google Bets on the Future With Launch of Stadia Game Streaming Service | Hollywood Reporter\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n\nMovies\nTV\nBusiness\nStyle\nTech\nAwards\nCulture\nPolitics\nVideo\nSites\n\nHeat Vision\nLive Feed\nEsq\nThe Race\nBehind the Screen\nBastard Machine\nRambling Reporter\nThe Fien Print\n\nSubscribe Newsletters\n\nSite Tools\n\nLog in\nDaily Edition\n\nVideo Games Behind The Screen\nTECH\n\nGoogle Bets on the Future With Launch of Stadia Game Streaming Service\n\n5:45 AM PST 11/19/2019 by Patrick Shanley\n\nFACEBOOK\nTWITTER\nEMAIL ME\n\nCourtesy Google\n\n\"You’re going to see a number of things that Stadia can do that is not possible on other platforms,\" says Jack Buser, director for games at the tech giant.\n\nGoogle's long-gestating foray into gaming has finally arrived as the tech giant's game streaming service, Stadia, launched Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Stadia has been built from the ground up to be a cloud platform,\" Jack Buser, director for games at Google, tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"You’re going to see a number of things that Stadia can do that is not possible on other platforms.\"\n\nGoogle's gaming offering, which is offered at a $9.99 monthly rate for its Stadia Pro subscription (there is also a $129.99 Premiere Edition available for preorder that includes a controller, Chromecast Ultra and three months of Stadia Pro and a free tier of the Stadia service is due out next year), is centered on the growing industry of game streaming, allowing players to access AAA titles while on-the-go through their smart phone device, tablet or computer, as well as their TV. The key to Stadia's success, says Buser, is Google's built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks in the world,\" he says, boasting that Google's servers can \"deliver extremely high fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless experience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device they choose to play on.\n\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was announced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed last week), featuring popular franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny and more. Notably, only one title at launch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works' Gylt, while most of the other games offered have been on the market for months on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia throughout the end of the year and into 2020.\n\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm IDC, sees Stadia's lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly subscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60 frames per second and discounts on certain titles (Destiny 2 is available for free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for Stadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the games having been on the market for some time already.\n\n\"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google’s planned 'free' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the hole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming community...and that should seed interest in the Founder’s Edition bundle and Pro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games catalog will probably stay fairly thin and there’s a lot of other gaming options out there.\"\n\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both of which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google's platform), Stadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an extension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early, senior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by letting people who maybe don’t own a console or PC join in.\"\n\n\"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader distribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We’re excited by the opportunity and we’ll see how it goes.\"\n\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the industry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not the only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony Now service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project xCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with plans for its full launch set for next year.\n\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these services in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\" Ward says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by several of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\n\n\"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with adequate bandwidth or you’re not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York, bandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still says Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the industry.\n\n\"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having an experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist today. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will break the boundaries of what was previously possible. It's just staggering.\"\n\nWhile Stadia's current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only three games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early says there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and launched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best game and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the interesting question is if we’re getting to a place that requires a game to be run in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not be that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a cloud base, whether that’s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become something we'd look at.\"\n\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also stepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade subscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was the list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple's offering, all of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out each week.\n\n\"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches next year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says Ward.\n\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the future of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early going. \"This is where you’ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he says. \"You’ll never download a game or have to download an update. We’re already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven’t seen it in games yet. It’s tough to go back to console.\"\n\nFACEBOOK\nTWITTER\nEMAIL ME\n\nPatrick Shanley\n\npatrick.shanley@THR.com @pshanley88\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n\n© 2019 The Hollywood Reporter\nAll rights reserved.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC.\n\nTerms of Use | Privacy | Sitemap | About Our Ads\n\nAbout Us\nDaily Edition\nSubscribe\nSubscriber Services\nBack Issues\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nTipline\nCareers\nIndustry Jobs\n\nFollow Us On Twitter\nFind Us On Facebook\nWatch Us On Youtube\n\nOur affiliate publications\n\nBillboard\nVibe\nSpin\nStereogum\n\nCookie Settings"

        "articleBody": "Unpredictable Sondland faces questions about Trump, Ukraine | Hosted\n\nSkip to main content\n\nMenu\n\nNews\nSports\nLandscapes\nEntertainment\nLife\nOpinion\nObituaries\nPublications\n\nNov. 20, 2019 5:52 AM EST\n\nUnpredictable Sondland faces questions about Trump, Ukraine\n\nBy LISA MASCARO, MARY CLARE JALONICK and ERIC TUCKER\nAssociated Press\nAP-US--Trump-Impeachment, 4th Ld-Writethru\nPatrick Semansky, ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the most anticipated witness in the impeachment inquiry, is likely to be unpredictable when he faces questions about his evolving accounts of the Trump administration’s dealings with Ukraine and a newly revealed summertime phone call with President Donald Trump.\n\nView all (23)\n\nSondland, a wealthy hotelier Trump tapped as his ambassador to the European Union, is more directly entangled than any witness yet in the Republican president’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and Democrats in the 2016 election. Yet Sondland has already amended his testimony once — “I now do recall,” he said, talking to Ukraine about investigations.\n\nSondland’s appearance at Wednesday morning’s hearing, and his closeness to Trump, is of particular concern to the White House as the historic impeachment inquiry reaches closer to the president, pushing through an intense week with nine witnesses testifying over three days in back-to-back sessions.\n\nTrump has recently tried to suggest that he barely knows his hand-picked ambassador, but Sondland has said he has spoken several times with the president and was acting on his direction.\n\nThe envoy is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers of both parties about Trump’s July 25 call when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the political investigations at the same time as U.S. military aid for the ally was being stalled.\n\nSondland routinely bragged about his proximity to Trump and drew alarm from the foreign service and national security apparatus as part of an irregular channel of diplomacy led by the president’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nLast week State Department official David Holmes revealed one of those interactions to impeachment investigators, saying he recalled it “vividly.”\n\nThe political counselor was having lunch with Sondland in Kyiv when the ambassador dialed up the president on his cellphone and Holmes could hear Trump’s voice.\n\n“I then heard President Trump ask, quote, ‘So he’s going to do the investigation?’” Holmes testified. “Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘He’s going to do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will, quote, ‘do anything you ask him to.’”\n\nSondland was known for telling others \"he was in charge of Ukraine\" despite being the U.S. envoy in Brussels, said another witness in the impeachment probe, former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill.\n\n\"And I asked, well, on whose authority?” said Hill, who will testify Thursday. \"And he said, the President.\"\n\nSondland’s appearance follows the testimony Tuesday of four national security and diplomatic officials, including a career Army officer who described Trump’s call with Zelenskiy as “improper.”\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman told lawmakers it was his “duty” to report his concerns about the call, as he deflected Republican attacks, including from the White House on his loyalty and career in public service.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Vindman had registered his concerns over Ukraine policy. He testified about a July 10 meeting at the White House when Sondland told visiting Ukraine officials they would need to “deliver” before the administration would agree to a meeting Zelenskiy wanted with Trump.\n\n“Ambassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens and Burisma in 2016,” Vindman testified, referring to the gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had a seat.\n\nAt the White House, Trump said he had watched part of the day’s testimony and slammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a “disgrace.” Over the weekend, Trump assailed Williams as part of the “Never Trumpers” who oppose his presidency, though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship.\n\nFormer National Security Council official Timothy Morrison told investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Sondland and a top aide to Zelenskiy. Afterward, Sondland said he had relayed to the Ukrainian that U.S. aid might be freed if the country would announce the investigations, Morrison testified.\n\nAnother diplomat, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, shifted his own account of the July 10 meeting to say Sondland did, in fact, discuss investigations with the visiting Ukrainians.\n\n“I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,” Volker said.\n\nA series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and other leaders in which they discussed a need for Ukraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma.\n\nVolker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani “raised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram, Zeke Miller, Laurie Kellman, Colleen Long, Eric Tucker, Lolita Baldor and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\n\nTopics\n\nGovernment and politics\n,\nLegal proceedings\n,\nImpeachments\n,\nMilitary legal affairs\n,\nInternational relations\n,\nTrump impeachment inquiry\n,\nDiplomacy\n,\nNational security\n\nPlaces in this Story\n\nUkraine\nDistrict of Columbia\nUnited States\n\nOrganizations in this Story\n\nUkraine government\nEuropean Union\n\nPeople in the Story\n\nRudolph Giuliani\nJoe Biden\nDonald Trump\n\nTrending\n\n'Tarzan' actor Ron Ely's wife killed; son shot by deputies\nIowa man finds 5 inches of animal blood flooding basement\nAirline went into records after Max crash, engineer says\n\n©2019 The Associated Press.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed a US announcement that it no longer considers settlements in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem illegal, but the Palestinians pledged new measures to oppose it. Jaafar ASHTIYEH / AFP\nHighlights\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\nThe United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on Tuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal, while the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.\n\nThe United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change the reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned the unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\" by the announcement.\n\nPompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the establishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international law\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\n\nThe decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the international community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring settlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did \"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\n\nThe EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\n\nNetanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of Jerusalem on Tuesday.\n\n\"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\n\nMore than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future Palestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nSettlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's administration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nAnalysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off potential legal moves against Israel.\n\nThe Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\n\nThe Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the Trump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called for an emergency meeting of the body.\n\nThe only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and Jordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\n\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of measures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\n\"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial investigation,\" he added.\n\nKey Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to varying degrees.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure contradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely further heighten tensions on the ground.\n\nThe French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to encourage... settlement building\".\n\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position that settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\n\nThe US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context for a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\n\nThe European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify products made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\n\nThe ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the coming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\n\nIsraeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing constituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of West Bank settlements into Israel.\n\n\"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an international consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said Avi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\n\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the Palestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally, externally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will stand tall.\"\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.\n\nVia SyndiGate.info\n\nCopyright @ 2019 The New Arab.\n\nYou may also like\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\nYou may also like\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up to our newsletter for exclusive updates and enhanced content\nSubscribe Now\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up to get Al Bawaba's exclusive celeb scoops and entertainment news\n\nLatest\nPopular\n\nUS: Top 100 Brands Are Worth More Than the GDP of Germany\n\nDubai’s Non-Oil Trade with Africa to Exceed $272 Billion\n\nNext Khashoggi?

Click here to support it.\n\nOrigin\n\nOn Nov. 15, 2019, former U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Shortly after, some of Trump’s defenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming that the ambassador’s net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because of some illicit means:\n\nWe have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\n\nThose making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found that this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such as Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no evidence. Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her part, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her alleged fortune.\n\nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\n\nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net worth:\n\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is no credible evidence for the estimates.\n\nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and Gossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch’s net worth far exceeded her salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered no evidence to support their estimates.\n\nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical information about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however, provide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch may have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead, they simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making any attempt to justify that figure.\n\nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they arrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information becomes available.\n\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12 million or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor appears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to discredit her U.S. House testimony.\n\nSnopes.com\nSince 1994\n\nA Word to Our Loyal Readers\n\nSupport Snopes and make a difference for readers everywhere.\n\nRead the Letter\n\nEditorial\n\nDavid Mikkelson\nDoreen Marchionni\nDavid Emery\nBond Huberman\nJordan Liles\nAlex Kasprak\nDan Evon\nDan MacGuill\nBethania Palma\nLiz Donaldson\n\nOperations\n\nVinny Green\nRyan Miller\nChris Reilly\nChad Ort\nElyssa Young\n\nMost Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?” Those tips launch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of political, scientific, legal, historical, and visual information.

Photo by David Dyer-Bennet.\n\nMore on Slate Book Review\n\nHow to Turn a Punishment Bureaucracy Into a Justice System\nThe 50 Best Nonfiction Books of the Past 25 Years\nJenny Slate and Her Editor on Refusing to Tidy Up Your Feelings in a Book\nThe Dark Enchantment of Carmen Maria Machado’s Memoir, In the Dream House\n\nThree years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a quest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The book was called The Dragon Waiting, and it was written by the late science fiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market paperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical fervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford’s obscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one of them.\n\nThe Dragon Waiting is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before George R.R. Martin wrote A Song of Ice and Fire, Ford created an alternate-history retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark magic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy. The Dragon Waiting provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of Gene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with another.\n\nI wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of this mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It’s currently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not available at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford’s career, the more frustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had won the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a beloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton, Ellen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and Daniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn’t anyone publishing his books?\n\nIt would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to the vast treasure trove of Ford’s uncollected and unpublished writing. It would introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn’t spoken to each other since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John M. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed republication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen? More importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly than that: How did he write those amazing books?\n\nJohn Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane Starner, “He was brilliant from the start—reading at an adult level when he was in kindergarten and talking to college students.” He played chess and loved model trains. But he was also sickly—after nearly falling into a coma at the age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana University, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and amassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two years, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first novel, Web of Angels, a cyberpunk book before the term was invented. Pocket published it in 1980.*\n\nAfter that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some beast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs, guarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is made up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often than not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. “When you’re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,” said Beth Meacham, one of his editors at Tor. “Every book contained a puzzle of some sort. And the play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple meanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.”\n\nAll his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will be utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital connections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading, and faith that the author knows what he’s doing are essential for navigating these moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the novelist Jo Walton explained them to me. “You’re only seeing the tenth of the iceberg that’s out of the water in every novel,” she said. “It makes it dense in a really powerful way, but sometimes it’s too hard for people because he wouldn’t spell things out.” When his editors would ask him to explain himself more, he’d respond, “I have a horror of being obvious.”\n\nFord also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people, and real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes, nor do they always understand what’s going on, particularly if they lack power, as Ford’s characters often do. If there’s one unifying theme to his books, it’s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In The Dragon Waiting, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed with guilt after committing her first murder. The Last Hot Time, an urban fantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own desire to be a dom in bed. Growing Up Weightless, a story of political intrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their children.\n\n“Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R. Martin.” — Neil Gaiman\n\nBut the novels were only the beginning. The errata of John M. Ford could fill volumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show called “Ask Dr. Mike” at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted out absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote handbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the maps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including The Eye of the World, the first book in Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series. His blog comments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King Edward IV.) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his Christmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or short satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every year during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called “Winter Solstice, Camelot Station,” went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it here.)\n\n“He would make art in the most surprising places,” Gaiman told me. “Once he wrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy Fawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.” When Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he would scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them for her to find. “Life was not long enough,” she recalled, “for Mike to do all the stuff that he would think of to do.”\n\n“He could have had a more successful career,” Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa’s husband and Tor’s editor in chief, said, “if he had been more disciplined about his writing” and stuck to one genre, or written a series. “But Mike wanted to write what he wanted to write.”\n\nNo single example illustrates this better than The Dragon Waiting and its aftermath. As Gaiman put it, “Had he taken The Dragon Waiting and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R. Martin.” Ford opted instead to write two Star Trek novels (The Final Reflection and How Much for Just the Planet?, both unexpected delights) and The Scholars of Night, a riff on midcentury British espionage thrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at its center. Gaiman still bemoans that The Scholars of Night “ should’ve been marketed like The Name of the Rose. You needed to go, `We have a great writer who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines high and low culture.’ ” Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St. Martin’s, published Scholars with a blank back cover. It didn’t exactly do Umberto Eco–level business.\n\nNeil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002.\nPhoto by David Dyer-Bennet\n\nEven if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack of insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. “All it took was one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,” Teresa Nielsen Hayden explained. “To be an adult about money would mean to be permanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the things that made his life so much better. And so he didn’t.”\n\nTo the extent that Ford’s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare, a health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a kidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made possible by the doctor’s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent that his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends, particularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited The Scholars of Night, and her husband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired Ford to work as a “games consultant” for the Wheel of Time series, mostly to help keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford as his “blood brother,” had essentially adopted him.\n\nFord needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family. The causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his mother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner says that Ford’s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford’s attitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God cheats at Scrabble. But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue was Ford’s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.\n\nThe two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had been married for two years when she and Mike began dating. “My partner to whom I am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle initial M,” Matthesen recalled in an email. “I used to refer to them collectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.”\n\n“The thing with Elise bothered” Ford’s family, Starner said. “I don’t know whether they were completely estranged before that or not.” But either way, at some point, Ford’s now-deceased father told Starner that “the only way I know he’s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.”\n\nIn his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words long, titled Aspects. Beth Meacham described it as “a magical-parliamentary-nobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.” When he’d finish chunks of it, he’d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton, and Meacham. They were all amazed by it.\n\nAlthough Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he struggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard it was to weave action into some parts of the story. “It’s not exactly like I can have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,” he wrote. Then, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so delighted his friends:\n\nIf a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is a high fantasy.\n\nIf he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.\n\nIf he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker story.\n\nTwo months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He was heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise Matthesen found him. “He looked a little surprised,” she wrote in an email. “Sort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.” Although he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was therefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had “married,” but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (“The Klingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,” was how Ford described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford’s family, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford’s passing. She would have one phone conversation with Ford’s mother. After that, everything would be done through lawyers.\n\nAccording to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006, Ford’s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his estate. But the document had been left in Ford’s apartment, which she could no longer legally access. Matthesen and Ford’s friends wanted some say in the disposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel were unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford’s body, cleaned out his apartment, and, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own memorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit Ford’s Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.\n\nBy 2018, when I started digging into this story, only The Last Hot Time, the story collection Heat of Fusion, and the two Star Trek novels remained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his major works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished Aspects, had reverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford’s family. No one had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal, and Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford’s literary estate and set up a foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story, repeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online) was that Ford’s family did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of print. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them for comment on this article.\n\nAn agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement community in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late nephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the family. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece were suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford’s sister, Martha Fry. “I cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print,” she said.\n\nAll contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness.\n\nMartha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they could do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of that interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or his parents, saying instead he was “introverted by nature.” “I once visited Mike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,” Dale wrote. “We went to an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. … Our parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We found some of the opened letters among his belongings.” Martha added that shortly before their father’s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the letter Mike wrote was “kind and loving.”\n\nThey also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike’s relationship with Elise. “Mike’s personal life was his own business and did not affect our feelings for him as a family,” Dale wrote. “I am appreciative to [Elise] for finding Mike’s body and calling the police. … Martha read a copy of the police report, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as ‘friend,’ not a legal spouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike found caring friends during his adult life.”\n\nThey refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple friends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote back, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that. Ford and Fry replied that I was threatening them with “the unsubstantiated beliefs of uncited individuals … if we do not respond to your satisfaction on Mike’s commercial affairs.” However, they volunteered that on three separate occasions they had written to Mike’s agent, trying to see if there was any interest in reprinting his work. When they didn’t hear back, they assumed there wasn’t.\n\nThis seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford and wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal. Was it really possible, I asked Ford’s friends, that his agent could have ignored his family’s requests?\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford’s agent had dropped out of the industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford’s death, his agent Valerie Smith “was beginning the process of essentially vanishing” from the industry. She “became more and more intermittent” with phone calls and correspondence, and many of her clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her in a decade.\n\nAfter a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone. Smith still found it difficult to talk about Mike Ford’s death and the events surrounding it. She had represented him since 1978. Web of Angels was the first novel she ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal battle unrelated to her literary work left her “pretty overwhelmed,” she said. Her heartbreak over Mike Ford’s death, an event that still leaves her angry today, helped push her further out of the industry. “When I started, I really felt like this was where I was meant to be,” she said. “I just can’t bring myself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.” Smith said she never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike Ford’s work.\n\nAnd so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage, seeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths remained obscure. I do not share Ford’s horror at obviousness, but there are simply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his family grew apart, or, from the family’s perspective, how far apart they were. We will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out Elise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)\n\nBut I reconnected Ford’s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of delicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have reached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me to Ford, The Dragon Waiting. Then, in 2021, Tor will publish—at long last—the unfinished Aspects, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.\n\nAs in one of John M. Ford’s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached. It’s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It’s not one that ties up every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that happen. But the ending they’ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and leaves their world a bit better off than when they started.\n\nWhen I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of Elise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford’s work, still smarting from the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?\n\n“I don’t even have words, it’s such good news,” she replied in an email. “Except maybe Mike’s words.”\n\nIn 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a prompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: I’m going to die. Tell me a story.\n\n“No,” he said. “No. You tell me one, and when you’re gone, I’ll tell it to somebody else.”\n\nCorrection, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first publisher of John M. Ford’s novel Web of Angels.

Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the “new Gannett,” as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations.\n\nSince 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole.\n\nNews industry analyst Ken Doctor\n\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don’t much care for.\n\n“Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,” says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That’s produced a strategy of “continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news.” The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\n\nThe merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said that he expects to wring as much as $300 million in “synergies” from the combination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the workforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it “immaterial”) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred.\n\nColumn: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in newspapers — for plundering\nColumn: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in newspapers — for plundering\nAmong those who believe that the press provides value for society — especially local journalism that slaps state and municipal politicians’ hands out of the public cookie jar — Alden Global Capital is a “vulture investing” firm that makes real vultures look good by comparison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources — with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole.\n\n(Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of Tribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake held by Tribune’s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9 million.)\n\nBut public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can’t escape the industry’s economic challenges.\n\nSacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry’s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company’s news assets.\n\nBut the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million. McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn’t have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government’s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\nMcClatchy’s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune’s largest shareholder.\n\nBusiness\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\nBusiness\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\nThe owner of the Los Angeles Times has a new name and a newly elected board, but it’s still dealing with some old business: dissatisfaction from some shareholders with its decision to spurn a buyout offer from rival Gannett Co.\n\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune’s large-market publications would have balanced McClatchy’s stable of smaller metro newspapers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having paid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.\n\nIndeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune. Both companies declined to comment on the assertion.\n\nThe most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation in the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as Alden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any savings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that’s where the news audience has been moving to.\n\nGateHouse hasn’t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm’s practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to “consolidate copy editing and page design” at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. “GateHouse-owned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,” Abernathy reported.\n\nReed, who will be the merged company’s chairman, told investors of New Media, the GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to quickly pay down debt and “to return capital to shareholders through dividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.” It shouldn’t escape notice that it’s not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with “investing for growth.”\n\nBusiness\nColumn: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\nBusiness\nColumn: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\nFreelance writers and photographers fear California’s new gig worker law will make them unemployable.\n\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as a major player in the company through an initial public offering and a bankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract.\n\nFortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will leave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an investor conference call as “morally wrong.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I know we’re happy to get rid of Fortress,” Cooperman told Reed. “They brought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they’re going to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn’t even take the money, given what they’ve done here.” (Cooperman is the billionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her proposal for a wealth tax.)\n\nPlunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that remains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. “Financial players like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,” says Doctor. “They see the way down as close to inevitable.”\n\nIn the news business that’s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public companies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have imposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on physical delivery — McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all its newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles online. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other national-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.\n\nAs traditional revenues continue to decline — and at an ever faster pace — those companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital news requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says, they’re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate destination remains unclear.\n\n“After two more years of this,” Doctor asks, “what kind of products are going to be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital subscription?

It’s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I’m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn’t want to spend it. He’s older and has health concerns and mobility issues.\n\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy I’m going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\n\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he’ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we’ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies’ room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don’t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\n\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her “sister” didn’t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.\n\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn’t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I’m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn’t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\n\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.\n\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTER\n\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don’t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's third child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10, during which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring.\n\nAndrew doesn’t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get pizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"\n\nAndrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn’t have been with Giuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he had a medical condition in which he couldn’t sweat.\n\n“Oh, actually? Yes,” he assures himself. “I didn’t sweat at the time.”\n\nBut, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he explained that he can sweat now.\n\nAndrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if there was any indication of Epstein’s crimes during the years in which they were friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply can’t remember.\n\n“There was no indication, absolutely no indication,” Andrew said. “And if there was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s] ‘Full Stop’ campaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those — time about getting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to look for but I never saw them.”\n\nThe fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn’t seem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.\n\nAs if all of this hedging wasn't enough to strengthen suspicion that the accusations are true, Andrew said he doesn’t regret his relationship with Epstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In other words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can teach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?\n\nThe interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew’s apparent guilt in associating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's done,\" Giuffre said before the interview. \"And I hope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nAndrew hasn’t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent denials speak volumes. Let’s hope we see more of Epstein’s associates — from politicians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler — grilled about their connections with him.\n\nUnfortunately, Andrew’s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his publicist quitting. After this, Epstein’s powerful friends will be more careful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what appears to be guilt.\n\nOpinion\nBeltway Confidential\nRoyals\nJeffrey Epstein\nSexual Assault\nMedia\n\nShare your thoughts with friends.\n\nMore Washington Examiner\n\nCarlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\nAnthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\nWednesday November 20, 2019\nOur family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week. A year ago Tuesday, our father, former Nissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn, was ambushed and arrested in Japan. He is finally free on bail, but his activities are highly restricted. We don’t know when his trial will begin and when his nightmare will finally end.\n\nPrince Andrew struggles to dispel allegations of sex with 17-year-old girl supplied by Epstein\n\nRob Crilly\nWednesday November 20, 2019\nThe television interview was devised as an opportunity for Britain’s Prince Andrew to set the record straight on his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and end questions about whether he had slept with a 17-year-old girl.\n\nWhat made Joker so popular?\n\nMadeline Fry\nWednesday November 20, 2019\nJoker killed at the box office.\n\nSen.

Report claiming US has the ‘world's highest rate of children in detention’ is bogus\n\nBecket Adams\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nVarious outlets, including Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press, National Public Radio, and Reuters, reported that a United Nations study showed that there are more “than 100,000 children in migration-related U.S. detention.” That sounds pretty bad. It means America “has the world’s highest rate of children in detention.”\n\nMarie Yovanovitch is the only impeachment witness so far to demonstrate a legitimate gripe\n\nEddie Scarry\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nAfter three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so far with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of the impeachment pursuit of President Trump.\n\nMedia and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials\n\nBecket Adams\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nIt is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and personal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including Ambassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\n'Hate to cause a stink': FCC chairman declines call to investigate alleged Swalwell flatulence\n\nDaniel Chaitin\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nThe mystery of whether Rep. Eric Swalwell passed gas during an MSNBC interview will squeak past scrutiny from the federal agency in charge of regulating the airwaves.\n\nKurt Volker throws Rudy Giuliani under the bus\n\nKaylee McGhee\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, has been tied to what Acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor dubbed the “irregular channel” of Ukraine policy, featuring Rudy Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and others. But Volker sought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday, making himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani’s meddling.\n\nDemocrats still haven't delivered 'the goods' on Trump impeachment\n\nJenna Ellis\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nPeople are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment “scandal.” In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly closed — Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his job. Here is what we learned:\n\nImpeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\nTom Rogan\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nBeyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-Ukraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to Ukraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr Zelensky's efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.\n\nFirst UK election debate was a total shambles\n\nTom Rogan\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nThe first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be held on Dec. 12 was a shambles.\n\nWhy the Democratic pivot from quid pro quo to 'bribery' is a bust\n\nTiana Lowe\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nThe core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did President Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign government to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats attempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the pivot bombed fantastically.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\nKaylee McGhee\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on Tuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine — of which there were many — directly to his superiors. He did not leak those concerns to the press, he said.\n\nConservatives boycotting Chick-fil-A are silly\n\nKimberly Ross\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nMonday's news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no longer donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community left some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the militant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, continue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the announcement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold Christian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\" will not be satisfied.\n\n'Just not accurate': GOP congressman rips New York Times over Vindman tweet\n\nDominick Mastrangelo\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nRep.

Afterwards, The Tennis Podcast team of Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts gave their initial impressions of the new format.\n\nIs it fair to say that the event was neither as bad as the sceptics thought it would be, nor as good as the organisers hoped it would be? Was it a misjudgement to hold the opening ceremony at 2:30pm on a Monday? Why have some Belgian fans boycotted the event? Should the doubles rubber be scheduled differently to make sure it is always live? And in what way was an authentic Davis Cup atmosphere created by fans on the smaller stadiums?\n\nM uch of the focus on day one was about the feel and staging of the event, rather than forehands and backhands, but there’s also discussion about Russia’s straightforward victory against defending champions Croatia, Colombia’s valiant effort against Belgium, and Canada’s exciting win over Italy.\n\nThe Tennis Podcast is produced weekly throughout the year, daily during the Grand Slam tournaments, the WTA and ATP Finals, and the Fed Cup and Davis Cup Finals.\n\nThis week's Tennis Podcast is sponsored by the Davis Cup by Rakuten Madrid Finals, which takes place 18-24 November.

All but four have now been released.\n\nPlague can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of people infected if not treated promptly.\n\nThe last major known outbreak in China was in 2009, when several people died in the town of Ziketan in Qinghai province on the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nIn May this year, travellers were left stranded in Mongolia after an outbreak of deadly bubonic plague killed a couple after they ate an infected Marmot.\n\nMost read in world news\n\nRANDY ANDY\n\nAndrew parties in unearthed pics despite claiming 'he avoids PDAs & can't sweat'\n\nTIME TRAVELLER\n\nConspiracy theorists say they've spotted Greta Thunberg in 120-year-old pic\n\n‘NAÏVE AND TRUSTING’\n\nGrace Millane ‘gave man on BDSM site list of kinky sex fetishes’\nWarning\n\nEYE POPPING\n\nRussian Popeye has 'rotting' tricep removed after injecting oil to look muscly\n\n‘GET WITH THE PROGRAM’\n\nFurious mum demands kids clothes have gender labels scrapped\n\nDRIVEN TO SUICIDE\n\nPregnant girl, 13, 'jumps to her death after she's gang raped by 6 men'\n\nAuthorities in western Mongolia, which is close to the Russian frontier, instituted a quarantine to prevent the disease from spreading.\n\nAmerican, Dutch, German, Swedish, Swiss, and South Korean tourists were marooned in Uglii as a result.\n\nHow is the plague spread?\n\nPlague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis - a bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas.\n\nThose infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubaction period of one-to-seven days, says the World Health Organization.\n\nSymptoms include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, along with weakness and vomiting.\n\nThe two main forms of plague infection are bubonic and pneumonic - where bubonic plague has spread to the lungs.\n\nBubonic is the most common form and is where people develop painful swollen lymph nodes, or 'buboes'.\n\nAt advanced stages of the infection, inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus.\n\nPlague is transmitted between animals and humans; by the bite of infected fleas; direct contact with infected tissues; and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.\n\nThose suffering from bubonic plague have a 30-60 per cent chance of dying from the disease.\n\nUntreated pneumonic plague is \"always fatal\", says WHO.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.\n\nHistorically, plague was responsible for widespread pandemics with high mortality.\n\nIt was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe.\n\nNowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics.\n\nResearchers have pinpointed the earliest evidence of the deadly illness to a placed called Laishevo in Russia\n\n6\nThe city of Uglii was closed earlier this year due to some plague-contaminated marmots Credit: Vesti/The Siberian Times\n\n6\nA couple in Mongolia in May 2019 who died are suspected to have eaten a Marmot - a large rodent Credit: The Siberian Times\n\n6\nOfficials were seen in Mongolia attempting to control the potential spread of the plague Credit: The Siberian Times\n\n6\nFears of contamination broke out after a husband and wife died from the deadly plague in Mongolia, in May Credit: The Siberian Times\n\nTopics\n\nHealth\nChina\n\nComments are subject to our community guidelines, which can be viewed here.\n\nPopular Articles\n\nSCORCHER\n\nDec takes baby Isla for walk in the Oz sunshine after revealing burn from dad duty\n\nWHO'S THE DADDY?\n\nEmmerdale fans stunned as paedo teacher Maya is revealed to be PREGNANT\n\nLett it be\n\nScarlett Moffatt insists Saturday Night Takeaway 'will be amazing' after axe\n\nBREAK THE ICE\n\nMum's speedy hack to get frost off your windscreen is hailed a 'game-changer'\n\nspice girl forever\n\nRomeo Beckham posts video of mum Victoria dancing to Spice Up Your Life\n\nComment\n\nFAT CHANCE\n\nThere's NO excuse for sending your kids to school with cold McDonald's\n\nANDY'S RICHES\n\nAndrew lives billionaire's life on £270k - so where does he get all his cash?\n\nDON'T CROSS DAD\n\nPeter Andre reveals he took away Princess' phone after she got detention\n\nExclusive\n\nRAG 'N' ALONE MAN\n\nRag 'n' Bone Man splits from wife just six months after tracksuit wedding\n\nSOAP-ER STARS\n\nI'm A Celeb newbies Andrew Whyment and Cliff Parisi prepare to join the camp\n\nFollow The Sun\n\nServices\n\nSign Up To The Sun\nAbout Us\nEditorial Complaints\nClarifications and Corrections\nNews Licensing\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nCommissioning Terms\nHelp Hub\nTopic A-Z\nCookie Settings\nContact Preferences\n\nThis feature allows The Sun to personalise your experience so that you get the most out of your visit.

Instead, they lost 24-17.\n\n“We talked all along about everything we wanted was still in front of us,” Lynn said, via the Los Angeles Times. “Yes, we needed to win this game today. I felt like if we could have won this game today and won out, we could control our own destiny. But now, obviously, I don’t feel that way. I still think we have enough to win next week and beyond that, but we probably are going to need some help.”\n\nAt 4-7, including 2-6 in the AFC and 0-3 in AFC West, the Chargers would probably not make the playoffs even if they win out. And given the way they’ve played so far and the three games remaining against teams with winning records, there’s no reason to think they’ll win out. Lynn is right: The Chargers needed to win that game.\n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\n\nPermalink 34 Comments Feed for comments Back to top\n\n34 responses to “ Anthony Lynn: “We needed to win this game” ”\n\nthelastchargersfan says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:34 am\n\nIt’s a good thing we have no fans left because this is a dumpster fire.\n\njoetoronto says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:44 am\n\nIt’s time for both Chargers fans to come to grips with reality, it’s over yet again.\n\ntheprocess12 says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:58 am\n\nAs usual too many mistakes by Rivers. As good as the class of 2004 QBs have been one of them always leads in INTs. With Hill out the KC offense doesn’t look that dynamic against a decent D. Don’t see how they can win 2 road playoff games.\n\nv2787 says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:02 am\n\nRivers is done. Get a new QB, Chargers. Philip has hit the wall. You’ve got a good team, but you need a QB who won’t throw interceptions. That “shot put” style of passing that Rivers has isn’t working anymore.\n\n4hourelection says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:06 am\n\nFeckless Chargers. Always the same.\n\nmargoadams says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:19 am\n\nAnother team suffering from a Super Bowl run hangover, courtesy of your New England Patriots. Demonstrates once again the incredible 20yr run the Patriots have been on.\n\nMortimerInMiami says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:23 am\n\nChargers are on the clock!\n\nsammievee says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:42 am\n\nIf you needed to win, understand that teams that needlessly spike the ball in final minute, giving up a valuable play while letting a beaten fatigued defense off the hook, usually loses that game. Instead, consider doing what legit teams do–practice during the week while preparing a play just for that situation. Then come up to the line of scrimmage and execute the play as you are not going to get a better chance than you had on first down with 24 seconds left and the opposing defense in utter disarray. Reid was choking again with the game management, I think I saw him doing high fives when Rivers spiked the ball and instantly turning the odds of scoring on that drive from 80% to 15% with that decision to spike the ball in that situation.\n\nmroklahoma says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:13 am\n\nWhat’s he supposed to say?\n\n6ringsandarapist says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:32 am\n\nDid anyone really think the Chargers would win?\n\nlonespeed says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:45 am\n\nPhilip Rivers looked like an aging quarterback. He looked as if he was projecting outward confidence, but he didn’t seem to have confidence in his ability. Kinda like when you get tired at the end of a long golf round. It started to manifest itself in mental errors and forced throws that weren’t crisp. Lots of batted balls and throws behind his targets. He might still be able to win a handful of games, but his days of leading a team to the playoffs are over. My guess is he retires at the end of this season.\n\ntheguiceisright says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:53 am\n\n“Yes, I need to bench Rivers”*\n\nI actually don’t think Tyrod is that bad, plus he looks pretty sweet in a chargers uniform\n\nC. M. says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:56 am\n\nObviously Rivers didn’t want too\n\nsolo681 says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nWhy did you not have a plan to bench Rivers, if necessary, just in case – you know, as it was necessary…\n\njjackwagon says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nTitans ran the ball right down the throat of the Chiefs D. With Gordon & Ekeler, it makes you wonder why the Chargers didn’t do the same. Poor game plan?\n\nRivers is no longer a QB that can carry a team with his arm but they still think he is.\n\nshutupbrees says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:47 am\n\ntwo weeks in a row the Chargers run for over 5.0 yards per carry, but insist on letting Philip Rivers drop back 50+ times. He seems like a good guy, but he’s done. He spends more time barking it up with opponents than any QB I’ve seen. It’d be funny if he wasn’t abysmal in the 2 minute drill throwing arm punt after arm punt.\n\nBob. Just Bob. says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:01 am\n\nTime to put Rivers on the shelf.\nThe dude just doesn’t have it anymore.\nHe’s become an interception machine.\nHe’s always been a risk-taker gunslinger type but it’s now gone past ridiculous.\nHave some mercy, Lynn; bench him while he still has a vestige of dignity remaining.\n\n6ringsandarapist says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:04 am\n\nFather time just pulled out his whoopin stick.\n\nbobmillion says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:13 am\n\nThe Chargers desperately need an O-coordinator that understands the players they have, instead of being that young innovative guru of trying to throw the ball on almost every play, especially with no tackles, try running the ball. The Bears could run the ball against what looks like to be a much worse KC defense, but idiot O-coordinator made Rivers throw the ball even though they have a very good running game, which leaves Rivers trying to force the ball in desperation as his career is clearly going off the cliff; sit him the rest of the year and let him walk in free agency is the best thing the Chargers can do, though Spanos will mess it up.\n\njbaxt says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:15 am\n\nTwo things… Why would you stop running Gordon?\n\nAlso, several “experts” picked the Chargers to win the AFC West.\n\ndevindenv says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:41 am\n\nChiefs Offense, without Hill, isn’t as dymnamic – as the poster above stated. Is that any f-ing surprise? But to say they cannot win 2 road playoff games overlooks the fact that the O-line. last night, was the first time in 6 weeks they have Eric Fisher back and the starting LG was back for the first time 3-4 weeks. Furthermore, tey are still down their best CB and a starting DE. The Bye week comes at a great time for them. We shall see as they have OAK in Week 13 and the Patriots in Week 14.\n\nfartweasel says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:32 am\n\nRivers is done. He just hasn’t accepted it yet. Great career, but his skills have diminished. Time to retire.\n\npatsfan4lifesbchamps says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:33 am\n\nAnthony Lynn is in over his head\n\npsi0016000 says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:46 am\n\nThe Chargers should sign Kapernick and make him the starter for the WHOLE 2020 season. In doing so, they will put and end to this ridiculous saga between Kaper and the NFL, where both sides are at fault.\nThis will also make possible, the transition from a declining and pathetic would be Hall of Famer, to a long time ago Super Bowl Runner up. Who knows …\nAnd then they should make a priority of ending up the 2020 draft, and 2020 free agency, with a boat load of OL, some of them being outright homeruns.\n\nOne last note : hire Dan Fouts as an assistant QB coach.\n\nHow about them Chargers !!!!\n\nWhy I Love Football says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:05 pm\n\n“Their going to need help along the way” ? … Man, the Chargers are going to need someone like Moses to lead them to the playoffs. I think Coach Lynn needed this win more than anyone in order to stay employed. Chargers and Bears are in a league of their own. They are stuck with no where to go.\n\nsmarter than you says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:07 pm\n\nWhat a worthless team, no history, no tradition, ugly uniforms, I’d rather be a Bengals fan\n\naveragjoe says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm\n\nThe look on Rivers’ face after each of those four (count’em, 4) INTs should end all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.\n\ngrumpysal says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:39 pm\n\nWatching last night’s game was like i was re-watching their game from a few weeks ago (?) where Rivers basically did the same thing (INT on last play) – I wondered during that game why the OC didn’t run the ball more and again last night.\n\nAfter being IN that game a few weeks ago, did the Chargers coaches think a different outcome was going to happen? I mean, do they even watch Rivers during the game? He was downright awful.\n\nMightyMidwest says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:18 pm\n\nMight as well take your ball & go to Sacramento, San Diego, Portland or wherever.\n\nMaybe Mexico City is an option?\n\ncafetero1075 says:\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:56 pm\n\nRivers has had bad seasons and bounced back.

Well, sort of. The group stage of qualifying finished on Tuesday, and 20 teams have booked their spots in next summer's tournament, which for the first time will be held across Europe. Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to earn the 20th spot on Tuesday. Aaron Ramsey scored twice for Ryan Giggs' team, as country makes it back to a tournament where it made the semifinals in 2016. The final four spots will come down to next March's Euro 2020 playoffs, whose teams are determined by their performance in the UEFA Nations League.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nThere's still a chance for these teams\n\nAs it stands, each group of teams below will play a semifinal and final for a spot at the tournament according to UEFA as part of the playoffs, with each path having one berth:\n\nPath A: Iceland, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\nPath B: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland\nPath C: Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*\nPath D: Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus\n\n*A draw will decide whether Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill the empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A.\n\nFour teams from there will join the field of 20.\n\nClinching in November\n\nOn Monday, Switzerland and Denmark clinched. Denmark got a 1-1 draw at Ireland, while Switzerland beat Gibraltar 6-0 to win Group D. The day before, Portugal made it as Bruno Fernandes scored the winner in the first half and Cristiano Ronaldo put it away in the second half. Portugal allowed only one shot on goal and converted half of its four chances to make it seven victories out of eight in all competitions.\n\nCroatia, Germany, Netherlands and Austria all qualified Saturday. Croatia secured its spot with a 3-1 victory against Slovakia, while Germany's 4-0 rout of Belarus was enough. The Netherlands clinched despite drawing with Northern Ireland, while Austria punched its ticket by beating North Macedonia.\n\nOn Friday, it was Finland and Sweden's chance. Finland clinched 3-0 against Liechtenstein, while Sweden did the same, 2-0, at Romania.\n\nAnd earlier in the week, Turkey drew Iceland 0-0 in Istanbul to book its spot, and that result also clinched France's ticket to next year's tournament, with the reigning World Cup champs looked at as one of the heavy favorites. Below are all the teams that qualified for the tournament during the group stage.\n\nQualified teams\n\nEngland (Group A): 10th appearance\nCzech Republic (Group A): Seventh appearance\nUkraine (Group B): Third appearance\nSpain (Group F): 11th appearance\nSweden (Group F): Seventh appearance\nPoland (Group G): Fourth appearance\nFrance (Group H): 10th appearance\nTurkey (Group H): Fifth appearance\nBelgium (Group I): Sixth appearance\nRussia (Group I): 12th appearance\nItaly (Group J): 10th appearance\nFinland (Group J): Zero appearances\nCroatia (Group E): Sixth appearance\nAustria (Group G): Third appearance\nNetherlands (Group C): 10th appearance\nGermany (Group C): 13th appearance\nSwitzerland (Group D): Fifth appearance\nDenmark (Group D): Ninth appearance\nPortugal (Group B): Eighth appearance\nWales (Group E): Second appearance\n\nRoger Gonzalez\nCBS Sports Writer\nfollow\n\nRoger Gonzalez is an award-winning writer based in Virginia that has covered pro soccer from Europe's top clubs to Argentina's first division.

(AP)\n\nIn October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\n\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\n\nBorder agents \"say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register.\n\nIs this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\n\nWe’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\n\nAs a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\n\nHere’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\n\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\n\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\n\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\n\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\n\nThat’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\n\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\n\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\n\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. That’s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout this statement:\n\nPublished: Monday, November 18th, 2019 at 11:08 a.m.\n\nResearched by: Matthew Digby, Minh Do\n\nEdited by: Louis Jacobson\n\nSubjects: Crime, Drugs, Immigration\n\nSources:\n\nThe Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register, \" Rep.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nPhoto: David Zalubowski, STF / Associated Press\nNew car sales plunge 10 percent in October\n1 / 9\nBack to Gallery\n\nNew vehicle sales in the Houston area plunged 10 percent last month, despite low interest rates and clearance deals.\n\nLocal auto dealers sold 30,154 new cars, trucks and SUVs in October, the second-highest sales volume of the year thus far but still down 10 percent from a year ago, according to the TexAuto Facts report from InfoNation, a Sugar Land-based provider of automobile data.\n\nConsumers have purchased 208,560 new vehicles this year, down 5 percent from the year-to-date period last year. Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent, while sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new vehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\n“People are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,” InfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, “2019 is just not as strong as 2018.”\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\n\nThe sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan stayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage rate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based automobile data firm.\n\nIndustry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten deals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder of the year.\n\n“The end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle purchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or SUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower financing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales\n\nDespite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing. The average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014, up from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\n\nThe average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the average price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New infotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup cameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up, McDowell said.\n\nHouston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments -- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle sales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September, it’s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month average of 15.2 percent.\n\nNationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an increase of just 0.3 percent from 2017. Edmunds expects 16.6 million vehicles will be sold this year.\n\npaul.takahashi@chron.com\n\ntwitter.com/paultakahashi\n\nMore Business News\n\nHouston Housing Authority sued over alleged open meeting...\n\nNew car sales plunge 10 percent in October\n\nHouston leads Texas in new home sales volume\n\nReport: Bank of America Tower sells for record per-foot price\n\nOil falls most in 7 weeks amid supply rise, trade impasse\n\nHouston’s economy might not be as hot as it looks — and...\n\nMost Popular\n\n1\n\n47 nabbed in massive Katy human-trafficking sting\n\n2\n\nHuman trafficking, prostitution sting near The Woodlands nets 75\n\n3\n\n14-year-old girl missing from The Woodlands, last seen at mall\n\n4\n\nCleveland ISD: White van being used to lure children\n\n5\n\nJ.J.

First it was hard to breathe, then dizzy spells caused by any amount of exertion.\n\n\"Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out,\" wrote 43-year-old Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in a case study published Monday in the journal BMJ.\n\n\"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 minute activity, as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" Taylor added.\n\nFour doctor appointments failed to find the cause, which was \"extremely distressing,\" wrote Taylor, who had never smoked. With his health failing, he stayed home from work and spent most of his days and nights asleep.\n\nTaylor didn't know at the time that he was suffering from hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disease in which lungs become inflamed as the result of an allergic reaction. Caught early, the disease is easily treatable. Undiagnosed, it can lead to permanent lung scarring, and even death.\n\nUnfortunately, in Taylor's case, the doctors he first saw had no clue as to the cause.\n\nTime for Dr. Sherlock\n\nAt first Taylor was treated for an upper respiratory infection. But his health continued to decline over the next three months. Then a radiologist dismissed a chest X-ray of his lungs as normal.\n\nConcerned, his family doctor put in a call to the urgent respiratory clinic and spoke to Dr. Owen John Dempsey, a consultant chest physician at BMI Albyn Hospital in Aberdeen, Scotland, about a 30-minute drive from Aberdeenshire.\n\n\"His general practitioner was very astute in not accepting the chest X-ray result at face value,\" Dempsey said, adding that it can be difficult to diagnose hypersensitivity pneumonitis because the changes are often subtle with just a \"slight diffuse greyness to the lungs.\"\n\n\"I think the radiologist may have thought it was just a slightly 'under-exposed' chest X-ray,\" Dempsey said.\n\nDempsey picked up the phone and rang Taylor.\n\n\"He sounded very breathless, having just walked from one room in his house to the other,\" Dempsey said. \"Very abnormal for such a young man. It was clear the patient had progressive and really very disabling breathlessness, now interfering with activities of daily life.\"\n\nMaking the diagnosis was \"a bit like a jigsaw,\" Dempsey said. One of the first clues was Taylor's blood work, which showed his immune system was exposed to avian protein. However, Taylor told Dempsey he didn't own any birds, just a cat and dog.\n\n\"I have a particular interest in this group of diseases,\" Dempsey said. \"And we know that if you take a meticulous history, you can often identify triggers in the environment for lung diseases.\"\n\nDempsey dove deeper: Taylor lived in a warm, dry house with his wife. They had a loft, which he didn't visit much, but they did have an en-suite bathroom with a bit of mold above the shower and window. He hadn't traveled to a foreign area. He had no drug history. He worked in an office with no obvious exposures. And he played guitar and saxophone in a local band.\n\n\"We are paid to be nosy,\" Dempsey said. \"The danger is that we don't ask enough and assume diseases are 'idiopathic' or unexplained. If so, we miss a trick and our patients are subjected to unnecessary tests or treatments.\"\n\nFinally, Dempsey's questions hit pay dirt: The couple had recently replaced their synthetic bedding with a feather duvet and feather pillows. Taylor had Feather Duvet Lung disease.\n\nAs Sherlock would say, \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"\n\nFeather Duvet Lung disease\n\nBird allergies are not uncommon. Often called bird fancier's asthma, symptoms can range from a wheezy cough, runny nose and eye irritation to asthma to more serious complications such as Taylor's. People with allergies are most at risk when bird cages or lofts are cleaned out, and during the time of year when birds molt and shed their feathers.\n\nFeather Duvet Lung disease is a subset of bird fancier's asthma, and it's difficult to diagnose because of its rarity and the wide variety in timing and type of symptoms.\n\nOnset of symptoms following exposure to new feather duvets or pillows can range from three weeks to five years. Difficulty in breathing can grow over time, and the patient can have night sweats, dry cough, weight loss and fever. The condition is often misdiagnosed if the person reports no birds in the home, and many doctors don't think to ask about bedding.\n\n\"Most doctors, in my experience, don't ask that level of detail,\" Dempsey said, adding that doctors should always ask about exposures at home, including bedding, molds, the warmth and dryness of the home, and any unusual hobbies or pastimes.\n\nEarly recognition of avian antigen exposure and removal of the bedding or other irritant is critical to recovery for patients, Dempsey stressed.\n\nSuccessful treatment\n\nWhile studies have not always supported the use of steroids, in this situation they were successful, especially since Taylor also removed the feather bedding.\n\n\"The steroids which were prescribed after diagnosis ... had a transformative effect within two days,\" Taylor wrote. \" The course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely.\n\n\"I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.\"\n\n© Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nRead More\nMicrosoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\nAdChoices\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nAd Microsoft\n\n24 Discounts Seniors Are Entitled To\niLoveRetirement\nJaw-Dropping Card Offers 0% Interest Until 2021\nThe Ascent\nForget Amazon; Here’s a Better Stock to Buy\nThe Motley Fool\n\nMore From CNN\n\nSimon Cheng: Former British consulate worker says he was tortured during China detention\n\nBest trips for 2020, according to National Geographic\n\nOhio University fraternity pledge death: 10 people indicted after investigation into the death of an 18-year-old student\n\nVisit site\nAdChoices\nFeedback\n\n© 2019 Microsoft\n\nPrivacy & Cookies\nTerms of use\n\nAbout our Ads\nHelp\nNewsletter\nMSN Worldwide\nDisclaimer\nAbout Health\nMSN Blog\nAbout Us\nEditorial Standards\n\nFound the story interesting?\n\nLike us on Facebook to see similar stories\n\nI'm already a fan, don't show this again\n\nSend MSN Feedback\n\nWe appreciate your input!\n\nHow can we improve?\n\nPlease give an overall site rating:\n\nSubmit Close\nPrivacy Statement\nHelp\nHelp & Support\nClose\n\nMake MSN my homepage\n\nOn the toolbar, click Safari.

Lee Senior Contributor\nOpinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.\nHealthcare\nI am a writer, journalist, professor, systems modeler, computational and digital health expert, avocado-eater, and entrepreneur, not always in that order.\n\nShare to facebook\nShare to twitter\nShare to linkedin\n\nHow can a duvet affect your lungs when it is too big to go up your nostrils? (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nThe Corrs’ song “Breathless” probably doesn’t refer to a duvet. However, it was this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a serious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\nWondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and even eventually be life-threatening? Well, go on, go on. This case report may leave you breathless.\n\nFor the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris RuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November 2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor initially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but contrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn’t get better afterwards. In fact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the point where he couldn’t walk from one room to another without getting out of breath.\n\nHere is how bad things got in the words of the patient: “Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep (day and night).”\n\nAt first glance, the man didn’t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless. He wasn’t a smoker. His workplace didn’t expose him to anything unusual. His main hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated that he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils.\n\nAh, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently “acquired” both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go on, go on.\n\nBreathing tests showed that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren’t moving as well between his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\n\nA CT of his chest showed a “ground glass” pattern in both of his lungs. Some lymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were consistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\nHP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your lungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to breathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird droppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers. When the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called “feather duvet lung.” When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is “bird fancier’s lung.” When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called “pigeon breeder’s lung.” If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken costume, well that doesn’t occur often enough to have its own name.\n\nWait there’s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what’s called “farmer's lung,” not to be confused with a farmer’s tan. “Humidifier lung” may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some similar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is “hot tub lung,” which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn’t. The bacteria in hot tubs can travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it’s not always good if what’s in a hot tub makes you breathless.\n\nNot all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic reaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm the reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the feather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling of mold. According to the man, the steroids “had a transformative effect within 2 days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the allergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.”\n\nEventually everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, “the course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%–98% which I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.”\n\nFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the inflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can result. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible. Not surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life threatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\n\nSo, if something is leaving you breathless and it’s not someone you fancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it’s the pigeons that you are breeding in your kitchen.\n\nBefore you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the flocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like “feather duvet lung” are still relatively uncommon. That’s why this case became a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may have seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where even the slightest touch and you feel weak.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed three Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\n\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s 18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops.\n\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group’s Haqqani network.\n\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support.\n\n“We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.”\n\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.”\n\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line.\n\nHe also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are profoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’ family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\n\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale and gaunt.\n\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether they were forced to speak.\n\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the hostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\n\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal when President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\n\nShare this:\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nCopy\n\nFiled under afghanistan, hostages, middle east, prisoners, taliban\n\nShare this article:\n\nShare this:\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nWhatsApp\nEmail\nCopy\n\nRead Next\n\nTeen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\nRead Next\n\nTeen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\nShare Selection\n\nTrending Now on NYPost.com\n\nThis story has been shared 44,976 times. 44,976\n\n120-year-old photo sparks Greta Thunberg conspiracy theories\n\nThis story has been shared 28,533 times. 28,533\n\nGoodwin: Why Dems are so worried after latest round of impeachment hearings\n\nThis story has been shared 19,590 times. 19,590\n\nSurgeons cut pounds of petroleum jelly out of 'Popeye' bodybuilder's biceps\n\nPopular Shopping\n\nApple’s best Black Friday deals 2019: iPhones, watches and more Apple’s best Black Friday deals 2019: iPhones, watches and more\nThe best Black Friday TV deals of 2019 The best Black Friday TV deals of 2019\nNow 50% off, this Bluetooth turntable lets you jam out retro-style Now 50% off, this Bluetooth turntable lets you jam out retro-style\nSlash an extra 15% off these early Black Friday sales Slash an extra 15% off these early Black Friday sales\nBest Black Friday deals on mattresses 2019 Best Black Friday deals on mattresses 2019\n\nNow On Now on Page Six\n\nTom Hanks discovers that he’s actually related to Mister Rogers Tom Hanks discovers that he’s actually related to Mister Rogers\nHollywood exec wanted Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman: screenwriter Hollywood exec wanted Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman: screenwriter\nMichael Jordan turns up to support NASCAR’s Denny Hamlin Michael Jordan turns up to support NASCAR’s Denny Hamlin\n\nSEE ALL\n\nVideo\n\nHalsey may be 'Bad at Love,' but she's damn good at looking sexy\n\nNow On Now on Decider\n\nCongressman Eric Swalwell Denies Ripping a Massive Fart Live on MSNBC Congressman Eric Swalwell Denies Ripping a Massive Fart Live on MSNBC\n\nSEE ALL\n\nMore Stories\n\npage six\n\nHarry Connick Jr.: Frank Sinatra was 'completely inappropriate' with my model wife\n\nnypost\n\n120-year-old photo sparks Greta Thunberg conspiracy theories\n\nNew York Post\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nMessenger\nEmail\nYouTube\n\nEmail Newsletters\nMobile Apps\nContact Us\nTips\nCoupons\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nMessenger\nEmail\nYouTube\n\nSections & Features\n\nNews\nTech\nMetro\nReal Estate\nPage Six\nVideo\nSports\nPhotos\nBusiness\nAlexa\nOpinion\nCovers\nEntertainment\nHoroscopes\nFashion\nNY Post Shopping\nSports Odds\nLiving\nClassifieds\nMedia\n\nNewsletters & More\n\nEmail Newsletters\nRSS Feeds\nStore\nPost Headliners\nHome Delivery\n\nSubscribe\nManage Subscription\nDelivery Help\n\nHelp/Support\n\nCustomer Service\nApp FAQ & Help\nContact Us\n\nTips\nNewsroom\nLetters to the Editor\nReprints\nCareers\n\nApps\n\niPhone App\niPad App\nAndroid Phone\nAndroid Tablet\nAdvertise\n\nMedia Kit\nContact\n\nPost Digital Network\n\nPage Six\n\nPage Six Style\n\nDecider\n\n© 2019 NYP Holdings, Inc.

(AP) — About a dozen black female small-business owners were gathered in a South Carolina shared workspace on Tuesday night for a networking event when they were told the newest 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, Deval Patrick, would be stopping by to introduce himself.\n\nWhen Patrick walked into the back of the room mid-meeting, the women turned around as he sheepishly apologized for his tardiness and short stay.\n\n“Don’t mind me!” he told them.\n\nBut the black former Massachusetts governor is eager to get their attention — and their vote.\n\nLaunching his bid for president less than three months before the Iowa caucuses, Patrick is betting that he can make his case to a broad coalition of voters, including many who remain undecided or uncommitted to anyone in the crowded field of candidates. To win South Carolina, which holds the first Southern primary of 2020, he would need a base of support from the black voters who comprise roughly two-thirds of the state’s Democratic electorate.\n\n“I’m running for president because those values of community, that we have a stake in each other and of generational responsibility, I think, are frayed in the country,” Patrick said Tuesday night in Columbia. “I come in humbly. ... I want to be a listener.”\n\nArguing that voters are just now beginning to tune in, with the first votes less than 100 days away, Patrick has said he will have visibility when the populace is really paying attention. His late entry, though, makes it that much tougher to raise the awareness that his campaign will need to meet the polling and fundraising thresholds for future debates.\n\nThis week, Patrick launched a tour of early-voting states, visiting Nevada and Iowa before South Carolina. It’s a state where former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained a significant polling lead for months, both across all spectrums and with black voters specifically.\n\nIt’s also a place where the two other major black candidates in the race — Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris — have struggled to gain momentum, despite months of campaign events.\n\nEyamba Sowers didn’t know Patrick was coming to Tuesday’s networking gathering but saw his visit as a pleasant surprise. The real estate agent said she related to him as someone who was also raised in a single-parent home, and she was impressed with his status as the country’s second elected black governor.\n\n“He has me thinking now,” said Sowers, who is also considering Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. She said if Patrick can get his message out, he’s someone voters could see defeating President Donald Trump in 2020 — her top priority.\n\nBeth Ruffin said she didn’t know much about Patrick before Tuesday’s event, but he left her intrigued and wanting to learn more. A former Beto O’Rourke supporter, she is a voter back on the market since his departure from the presidential race.\n\n“It sounded like strong black women raised him,” said Ruffin, who owns a diversity and inclusion consulting firm and headed out for Patrick’s second stop at a nearby restaurant, where he was warmly greeted by a crowd of several dozen. “I want to see how he translates that into policy.”\n\n___\n\nReach the reporters on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP and http://twitter.com/emarvelous\n\nMost Popular\n\n1\n\nLongtime CT gunmaker leaving state for Wyoming\n\n2\n\nShelton teacher realizes dream on Wheel of Fortune\n\n3\n\nPolice call disappearance of bar owner ‘suspicious’\n\n4\n\nFairfield dumping documents unsealed\n\n5\n\n3 busted after CT raid finds fentanyl-laced heroin\n\n6\n\nBrickyard Pub owner charged with selling cocaine at Fairfield restaurant\n\n7\n\nPolice: Gift card scam costs Derby woman nearly $10K\n\nConnecticut Post\n\nView Comments\n© 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc.\nLogo Return to Top\n\nAbout\n\nPrivacy Notice\nInterest Based Ads\nYour California Privacy Rights\nTerms of Use\nCareers\nAdvertising\nArchives\n\nContact\n\nContact Us\nFAQ\nToday's eEdition\nSubmissions\n\nConnect\n\nNewsletter Sign-Up\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\nHearst Newspapers © Copyright Hearst Media Services Connecticut, LLC"

At the time, Lexus called the vehicle a concept despite looking ready to hit showrooms and streets worldwide.\n\nNow, at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Japanese luxury marque has finally pulled the covers off the production model 2020 LC 500 Convertible.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the LC 500 Convertible looks largely similar to the LC Convertible Concept previewed in January. Most of the design cues has simply been carried over. However, it seems the more stylish wheels on the Concept appears to have been ditched in favor of the standard units fitted on the Coupe.\n\nStyling-wise, the biggest difference between the Convertible and the standard LC 500 would be the lack of a roof and a revised rear deck. In place of a fixed metal roof and the large backglass is a retractable fabric soft top. Lexus engineers have hidden the frame underneath the material so that it won’t be seen with the roof in place. No doubt the LC 500 Convertible looks very stylish with the roof down. However, some might find it’s roofline a bit strange with the soft-top roof up.\n\nShould the weather take a turn for the worse, drivers can operate the folding soft-top to close in just 16 seconds at speeds at up to 50 km/h. Meanwhile, it just takes 15 seconds to fold the roof down and give occupant open-air freshness. The air-conditioning system also automatically adjusts cabin temperature whether the top is up or down. The rest of the cabin has simply been carried over from the coupe.\n\nIn order to make up for the lack of a roof, Lexus Project Manager Fumihiko Hazama shared with AutoIndustriya.com that they have improved chassis rigidity by adding x-braces. The front suspension has also been revised in order to reduce unsprung weight. At the rear, the suspension brace has been relocated and reshaped in order to improve structural rigidity.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s the same 5.0-liter V8 engine which produces 471 horsepower and 540 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. To hear the V8 better, a pipe channels engine noise into the cabin.\n\nThe Lexus LC 500 Convertible will go on sale in summer 2020. Considering how Lexus Philippines offers almost all Lexus models locally, it's possible the LC500 Convertible could arrive in the future.\n\n- Next Auto News\n\n2020 Mini JCW GP is a 300HP monster hatch\n\nThe most powerful Mini hot hatch to come out of Oxford has 306 HP and a huge rear wing\n\nMarcus De Guzman 2019-11-20 17:27:46\n\nPrevious Auto News -\n\nRenault to challenge Xpander, Avanza with 7-seat 2020 Triber\n\nRenault's latest seven-seater MPV only measures less than 4 meters long\n\n2019-11-20 12:57:32 Marcus De Guzman\nTags: lc 500 lexus lexus lc lexus lc 500 lexus lc convertible\nMORE STORIES LIKE THIS ONE\nAUTO NEWS\n\n2017 Lexus LC500 coupe arrives in the Philippines\n\nMay 15, 2017\nCAR REVIEWS\n\n2017 Lexus LC 500\n\nJanuary 22, 2018\nAUTO NEWS\n\nNAIAS 2016: All-new Lexus LC500 makes world premiere\n\nJanuary 12, 2016\nADVERTORIAL\n\n5 reasons why a Lexus hybrid is the perfect first step to electrified driving\n\nOctober 18, 2019\nAUTO NEWS\n\nDrop top 2019 Lexus LC Convertible is a gorgeous breath of fresh air\n\nJanuary 14, 2019\nFEATURES\n\nFirst Impressions: 2013 Lexus IS 350, IS 350 F Sport\n\nJune 18, 2013\nAUTO NEWS\n\nThis topless Hyundai Santa Fe is the strangest thing you'll see today\n\nSeptember 12, 2018\nCAR REVIEWS\n\n2018 Lexus ES 350\n\nOctober 19, 2018\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus\nFIND YOUR NEXT CAR\nChoose vehicle brand Abarth Alfa Romeo Aston Martin Audi BAIC Bentley BMW BYD Changan Chevrolet Chrysler Dodge Ferrari Ford Foton GAC Geely Great Wall Haima Honda Hyundai Isuzu JAC Jaguar Jeep JMC Joylong Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lifan Lotus Mahindra Maserati Maxus Mazda Mercedes-Benz MG Mini Mitsubishi Nissan Peugeot Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce SsangYong Subaru Suzuki Tata Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Choose model\nRECENT ARTICLES\nAUTO NEWS\n\n2020 Aston Martin DBX SUV is what 007 drives when he has kids\n\nAston Martin officially reveals 2020 DBX with 550 horsepower V8 from the Vantage\n\nJose Altoveros\nAUTO NEWS\n\n2020 Mini JCW GP is a 300HP monster hatch\n\nThe most powerful Mini hot hatch to come out of Oxford has 306 HP and a huge rear wing\n\nMarcus De Guzman\nAUTO NEWS\n\nAudi e-Tron Sportback makes electric crossovers look good\n\nAudi’s second electric vehicle – the E-Tron Sportback – officially debuts\n\nJose Altoveros\nAUTO NEWS\n\nAll-new 2020 Sentra is what we really want from Nissan PH\n\nWill we call 2020 Nissan Sentra as the Sylphy should it arrive in ASEAN?\n\nMarcus De Guzman\nAUTO NEWS\n\nRenault to challenge Xpander, Avanza with 7-seat 2020 Triber\n\nRenault's latest seven-seater MPV only measures less than 4 meters long\n\nMarcus De Guzman\nPOPULAR THIS WEEK\nAUTO NEWS\n\n2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, G4: This is it\n\nIs Mitsubishi Motors Philippines about to launch the 2020 Mirage (and Mirage G4) soon too?\n\nAnton Andres\nAUTO NEWS\n\nHours after reveal, 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, Mirage G4 get kitted out\n\nLess than a day since its reveal, Mitsubishi already decks out the Mirage hatch and Mirage G4\n\nAnton Andres\nAUTO NEWS\n\n2020 Ford Ranger FX4: coming soon to PH?\n\nLike the previous model, the new Ford Ranger FX4 is two-wheel drive only\n\nAnton Andres\nAUTO NEWS\n\nAll-new 2020 Sentra is what we really want from Nissan PH\n\nWill we call 2020 Nissan Sentra as the Sylphy should it arrive in ASEAN?\n\nMarcus De Guzman\nAUTO NEWS\n\n2020 Chevrolet Colorado RS isn't what you think it is\n\nChevrolet adds some visual spice to the Colorado with the limited RS model\n\nAnton Andres\n\nBuyers Guide\nAuto News\nCar Reviews\nTransport & Logistics\nFeatures\nTruck & Bus Features\nAuto Shows\nInside Man\nEditor's Note\nMotorsports\n\nAutoIndustriya.com is the leading automotive resource for the Philippines.

You’re promised a smooth ride in the fastest performance car available; but it would appear that’s not exactly the case. For example, the Google Stadia Red Dead Redemption 2 port doesn’t run at a solid 60fps.\n\nPosted on social media by the performance analysts at Digital Foundry, the Stadia port of Rockstar’s Western video game is not entirely smooth on the streaming service.\n\nThose playing through Stadia’s recommended Chromecast Ultra will be treated to a 30fps experience in Red Dead Redemption 2. While not ideal for a service that boasts such a high technical makeup, recent impressions appear that the 30fps lock is at least fairly stable.\n\nIt’s when the Google Stadia Red Dead Redemption 2 port attempts to run at an ideal 60fps in the Chrome browser where users will run into issues. Preliminary tests by Digital Foundry reveal that the game runs at an unstable performance level.\n\nThe group state that the two modes are similar to performance and quality modes on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro. While Chromecast users enjoy the game at a reasonably solid 30fps with 4K output, those who play through the Chrome browser will experience an unstable 1080p 60fps.\n\nInteresting to see Stadia RDR2 capture out there running at an unstable 60fps. A bit tired here and Stadia barely runs on my home connection right now for some reason, but Saturday night's Chromecast captures are indeed 30fps, while Chrome browser output seem to be aiming for 60. pic.twitter.com/4p7SXk7JPW\n\n— Digital Foundry (@digitalfoundry) November 18, 2019\n\nWe recently traveled to Google’s offices in London to try Stadia for ourselves. We called it “an incredible feat when it decides to work.” It’s peak Google.

A spokesperson who did not wish to be named because of agency policy said in a statement emailed to NBC News that the agency never has administered vaccines and people aren't usually held in custody very long.\n\n© Lucy Nicholson Detainees at Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San Diego, Calif., on May 18, 2018.\n\n\"As a law enforcement agency and due to the short term nature of CBP holding and other logistical challenges, operating a vaccine program is not feasible,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAlthough CBP’s guidelines recommend holding people no longer than 72 hours, the agency has been holding people far longer as arrivals of migrants seeking asylum spiked last year and this year, although they have since fallen.\n\n\"We write with urgency\"\n\nIn a Nov. 5 letter to Kevin McAleenan, who was the acting director of the Department of Homeland Security and Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services secretary, said they would provide 100 doses of the influenza vaccines and four volunteer physicians to administer them. McAleenan resigned and Chad Wolf has been named new DHS acting secretary.\n\n\"This is how epidemics begin,\" Dr. Luz Contreras Arroyo, a member of the group and signatory to the letter, told NBC News. \"It's not just migrants. Workers will come out to communities, potentially spreading that virus and it could get out of control.\"\n\n\"These are people as well,\" Arroyo added, speaking of the detained families. \"They are under the care of the government, most not having committed crimes. Seeking asylum is not a crime.\"\n\nThe group had set a deadline of Tuesday for the administration to respond before making the request public.\n\nThe doctors warned that migrants are not the only people at risk of illness.\n\n\"Flu season has already begun in many parts of the country, so we write with urgency,\" the doctors stated. \"Many people, including those working at and living near CBP facilities, will be at an even higher risk than what is typical.\"\n\nThe doctors contributed money and raised more from friends and others to pay the cost of the vaccines. Physicians are volunteering their time to provide the shots, said Arroyo, a Sacramento family medicine physician and psychiatrist.\n\nThe doctors said they also have an established volunteer network of physicians licensed to operate in all states to get the necessary vaccines and work with CBP to “create a system to ensure that the majority of migrant families” held in CBP custody are vaccinated.\n\nThey hope for government funding to help pay the cost for vaccines systemwide. If not, they will try to find other funding.\n\n\"Alarming mortality rate\"\n\nThe doctors said that based on an estimated 200,000 children in federal custody in the past two years, the three deaths of detained children attributed to complications from the flu are nine times higher than the expected death rate for children from flu.\n\n“In our professional medical opinion, this alarming mortality rate constitutes an emergency which threatens the safety of human lives, particularly children,” says the letter signed by seven physicians.\n\nIn August, CBP announced that it would not be vaccinating migrant families in its holding centers ahead of the flu season. At the time, the agency said in a statement that it chose not to provide the vaccinations because of the “short-term” stays of immigrants in custody and the complexities of operating a vaccination program.\n\nBut Arroyo said the government has done wide scale vaccinations before and given out large amounts of vaccine to prevent illness from spreading and prevent epidemics. She said it is cost effective and less than the cost of hospitals and ICUs for detainees, staff and residents once they become sick.\n\nCBP's cells and pens of chain-link fence with concrete floors and holding rooms are known to be very cold and are often called hieleras, which translates to freezer or icebox, by those held in them, which include infant children.\n\nHealth care providers have protested longer detention periods for migrants, warning that children in particular would face more serious health risks with the extended incarcerations.\n\nOvercrowded conditions worsen risk\n\nThe doctors offering to operate the flu vaccination clinic noted findings of overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at detention facilities by the DHS Office of Inspector General.\n\nThat report found children in some CBP facilities didn’t have access to showers, didn’t always have opportunities to change clothes and that they had limited space for medical isolation. In an El Paso facility, a cell meant for 35 held 155 adult males with only one toilet and sink, NBC News reported.\n\nA flu outbreak at the CBP McAllen facility affected nearly three dozen immigrants and required a temporary suspension of operations.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control recommends all individuals above age 6 months get a flu vaccine by the end of October for the current flu season. Even the policy manual of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Homeland Security Department, notes the CDC requirement that immigrants be vaccinated for flu.\n\n“As physicians, we have seen the effects of flu infections in the strongest as well as the most vulnerable, and the outcomes can be devastating,” the physicians stated.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nRead More\nMicrosoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\nAdChoices\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nAd Microsoft\n\n24 Discounts Seniors Are Entitled To\niLoveRetirement\nJaw-Dropping Card Offers 0% Interest Until 2021\nThe Ascent\nForget Amazon; Here’s a Better Stock to Buy\nThe Motley Fool\n\nMore from NBC News\n\nAnalysis: A damaging day of impeachment hearings for Donald Trump\n\nState Department asked to probe top diplomats' use of personal cell phones\n\nNew York college student, 20, falls to death while hiking\n\nVisit site\nAdChoices\nFeedback\n\n© 2019 Microsoft\n\nPrivacy & Cookies\nTerms of use\n\nAbout our Ads\nHelp\nNewsletter\nMSN Worldwide\nMSN Blog\nAbout Us\nEditorial Standards\n\nFound the story interesting?\n\nLike us on Facebook to see similar stories\n\nI'm already a fan, don't show this again\n\nSend MSN Feedback\n\nWe appreciate your input!\n\nHow can we improve?\n\nPlease give an overall site rating:\n\nSubmit Close\nPrivacy Statement\nHelp\nHelp & Support\nClose\n\nMake MSN my homepage\n\nOn the toolbar, click Safari.

McDonald came out during the encore for a surprise version of their single “Takin’ It to the Streets,” the title track of their 1976 album, the first with McDonald in the lineup.\n\nFollowing a performance of their sing-along jam “Black Water,” Simmons teed up McDonald’s cameo. “You might remember him from, well, he has his own band these days,” he said. “But you might remember him from his band, the Doobie Brothers — Mr. Michael McDonald.”\n\nRelated\n\nThe Doobie Brothers: Lighting Up With the Stars of 'This Is the End'\n\nMichael McDonald Talks Doobie Brothers' New Album, Donna Summer and Retirement\n\nRelated\n\nDave Grohl's Guest List: 21 Amazing Musical Cameos\n\nMarty Stuart on Making Ken Burns' 'Country Music'\n\nDressed in black pants, an untucked black shirt, and glasses, the white-haired McDonald took his place at a keyboard at the front of the stage and began the intro to “Takin’ It to the Streets.” The reaction from the crowd, a mix of boomers and nostalgia-loving Gen-X’ers, was rapturous and they called for more even as the lights came up signaling the official end of the night.\n\nTickets for the 50th anniversary tour go on sale to the general public starting Friday, December 6th, at 10 a.m. local time via Live Nation.\n\n“We’re truly excited about our 50th Anniversary Tour, as it’s a celebration of the band’s entire history,” Johnston said in a statement. “We’ll be performing songs from our full catalog, as well as new music.”\n\nMcDonald joined the band in 1975 and initially remained in the lineup until 1982, appearing on four albums and hit singles like 1978’s “What a Fool Believes.” He later performed with the band on multiple occasions.\n\nThe band’s current tour continues November 19th in Greenville, South Carolina; after a break later that month, the schedule picks up February 7th in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers Tour Dates\n\nJune 9 – West Palm Beach, FL @ Coral Sky Amphitheatre\nJune 10 – Tampa, FL @ MIDFLORIDA Credit Union Amphitheatre\nJune 14 – Alpharetta, GA @ Ameris Bank Amphitheatre (Formerly Verizon Amphitheatre)\nJune 17 – Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone Arena\nJune 19 – Charlotte, NC @ PNC Music Pavilion\nJune 20 – Raleigh, NC @ Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek\nJune 23 – Virginia Beach, VA @ Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater at Virginia Beach\nJune 24 – Bristow, VA @ Jiffy Lube Live\nJune 26 – Allentown, PA @ PPL Center\nJune 27 – Camden, NJ @ BB&T Pavilion\nJune 29 – Holmdel, NJ @ PNC Bank Arts Center\nJune 30 – Wantagh, NY @ Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater\nJuly 2 – Uncasville, CT @ Mohegan Sun Arena\nJuly 3 – Mansfield, MA @ Xfinity Center\nJuly 19 – Toronto, ON @ Budweiser Stage\nJuly 22 – Cuyahoga Falls, OH @ Blossom Music Center\nJuly 26 – Saratoga Springs, NY @ Saratoga Performing Arts Center\nJuly 30 – Noblesville, IN @ Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center\nAugust 2 – Clarkston, MI @ DTE Energy Music Theatre\nAugust 4 – Cincinnati, OH @ Riverbend Music Center\nAugust 8 – Tinley Park, IL @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre – Chicago\nAugust 14 – St. Louis, MO @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre – St. Louis\nAugust 30 – Denver, CO @ Pepsi Center\nSeptember 2 – Salt Lake City, UT @ USANA Amphitheatre\nSeptember 5 – Seattle, WA @ White River Amphitheatre\nSeptember 12 – Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre\nSeptember 18 – Los Angeles, CA @ The Forum\nOctober 3 – Phoenix, AZ @ Ak-Chin Pavilion\nOctober 9 – Irving, TX @ Toyota Music Factory\nOctober 10 – Houston, TX @ The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Hudak\n\nIn This Article: direct, Doobie Brothers, Michael McDonald, VSRock\n\nWant more Rolling Stone?

After all, we should be humble and give the driver some amount of credit, before we decide that we know better than them and say that they are stupidly doing something that’s not in their own best interest.\n\nLogically, there must be some speed at which it’s no longer better (in terms of overall utility) to be slower — if not, the speed limit would be 1 MPH. Are we sure that those buses are currently travelling above that ideal speed?\n\nGary M on September 17, 2018 at 8:50 pm said:\n\nHave you written anything about the trade-off between giving now vs investing the money and giving in the future?\nIn particular it seems like effective altruism research is still improving quickly, so we might be able to give more effectively in the future.\n\nCatherine (GiveWell) on September 19, 2018 at 12:48 pm said:\n\nHi Alex,\n\nOur best guess is that any effects on vehicle speed are fairly small. We have limited data on this question; the only information we have is from the 2015 randomized controlled trial (RCT). We write in our report on Zusha!:\n\nIn Habyarimana & Jack 2015, the authors try to test mechanisms, but the evidence is mixed. There is no significant difference in reports of reckless driving or passenger complaints between the treatment and control vehicles. There is also no significant difference in maximum moving speeds. However, the average moving speed was slower for treatment vehicles than control vehicles, by about 1 km/h on average.\n\nReductions in average speed at levels similar to that referenced above are small enough that we don’t model the disutility. That said, this study raises the question of the mechanism by which accidents are reduced, if speeds don’t change. Our question about the mechanism by which the reduction in accidents occurred is one of our key uncertainties about the program, and is one of the factors that led us to discount our best-guess effect of the intervention more than for most programs with RCTs we’ve looked at.\n\nCatherine (GiveWell) on September 20, 2018 at 10:07 am said:\n\nHi Gary,\n\nWe detailed several considerations related to giving now versus later in this 2011 blog post.\n\nWe see the following general arguments in favor of giving now and giving later.\n\nIn favor of giving now:\n* It may become less cost-effective to help people in the future, due to general economic development and improvements in living conditions, and so some of the best opportunities to save or improve a life today may not exist in the future.\n* Accomplishing good today may “earn interest,” by empowering people and positioning them to help others in the future.\n\nIn favor of giving later:\n* We might find more cost-effective programs in the future, through our Incubation Grants program or by researching and reviewing new areas, such as policy advocacy.\n* An opportunity that looks good now could look worse in the future (for example, because we learn new information or because it runs out of room for more funding).\n\nOn balance, our best guess is that the benefits of giving now are likely to outweigh the benefits of giving later, although we have a high degree of uncertainty around this. Some of the additional factors raised in the 2011 blog post also point in favor of giving now, such as providing an incentive to think carefully about where to give each year and helping charities plan around your gifts.\n\nIn addition, here are some resources outside of GiveWell from the effective altruism community that may be of interest in thinking about this question:\n* Effective Altruism Forum roundup of writings on this topic\n* 2015 Global Priorities Project write-up, with flowchart\n\nMohammad on September 29, 2018 at 12:16 am said:\n\nHi,\nI recently stumbled upon this old blog post (https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2012/12/some-general-concerns-about-givewell/) by William MacAskill and was very interested in this remark:\n\n“GoodVentures’ endowment could easily use up the room for more funding at GiveWell’s top charities. So it raises the question why GoodVentures doesn’t donate to GiveWell’s top charities: even if not exhausting their room for more funding, at least using up a considerable proportion of it. The most plausible explanation in my mind is that GiveWell thinks that GoodVentures can better spend its money at a later date after further research. In which case, it’s hard to see why individual donors shouldn’t save and donate later, or even try to give to GoodVentures. Perhaps that’s wrong, but it’s worthy of discussion.”\n\nI wanted to know if there had been any further discussion on it by GiveWell or others. If there hasn’t, could GiveWell give a response now? Is the reason GoodVentures is not exhausting its funds to close these gaps every year because they are holding out for a future opportunity? Or is it to strategically leave behind some funding gaps so as to entice individiual donors like myself who are attracted to effectiveness, and thus in the grand scheme of things there will have been moved a greater sum of money in totality?\n\nOlivia (GiveWell) on October 4, 2018 at 10:58 am said:\n\nHi Mohammad,\n\nThanks for your question.\n\nGood Ventures is a large charitable foundation which works closely with GiveWell, although the two organizations are distinct from one another. Good Ventures sets its overall grantmaking budget independent from GiveWell, according to its own cause prioritization. In 2017, Good Ventures’ giving to GiveWell’s top charities derived from its assumption that, in the long run, 10% of its total available capital would go to “straightforward charity” (as opposed to more speculative causes or worldviews), expected to align with GiveWell’s research and recommendations. You can read about the reasoning for Good Ventures choosing 10% in detail here.\n\nGiveWell was involved in discussions with Good Ventures about the allocation of this pool of its funding in 2017, but, as we noted in our blog post announcing our updated top charities, “the amount [Good Ventures gave to our recommended charities] was based on discussions about how to allocate funding across time and across cause areas. It was not set based on the total size of top charities’ funding gaps or the projection of what others would give.”\n\nCharles Pritchard on October 27, 2018 at 8:34 pm said:\n\nHave there been any further discussions or analyses performed in relation to the Partners in Health programs following the 2012 update?\n\nhttps://www.givewell.org/international/charities/PIH\n\nCatherine (GiveWell) on October 29, 2018 at 12:06 pm said:\n\nHi Charles,\n\nWe have not prioritized further investigation into Partners in Health since our 2012 review was published.\n\nComments are closed.\n\nfacebook twitter print email\n\nRecent Blog Posts\n\nWant to stay updated on GiveWell's research?

Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we work closely.\n\nSummary\n\nThis post will discuss the following:\n\nWhy Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More)\nRisks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More)\nOur plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (More)\n\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\n\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\nA key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\n\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\n\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence Action, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\nModeling cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\n\nThis could occur:\n\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\n\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\n\nRisks to the success of the grant\n\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\nFew programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\nWe expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\n\nGoing forward\n\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\n\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n\nPosted in GiveWell Incubation Grants | Permalink | 1 Comment\n\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\n\nComments\n\nJamie Cassidy on November 15, 2018 at 10:12 am said:\n\nI am so pumped about this!

The fight for African American voters is raging. And there are growing concerns that impeachment may become a distraction from the primary. Those issues and more will play out Wednesday night when the Democratic Party’s top 10 face off in Atlanta just 75 days before primary voting begins.\n\nSeven big questions heading into the debate, to be carried on MSNBC:\n\nWHO IS THE FRONT-RUNNER?\n\nTurbulent polling across the early voting states has created a murky picture of the top tier of the 2020 class. As much as Joe Biden is still a front-runner, so are Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. The question is who gets the front-runner treatment in Wednesday’s debate. Warren was under near-constant attack last month as a new leader. Will Warren continue to face the heat, or will the ascendant Buttigieg or weakening Biden take more hits?\n\n___\n\nHOW WILL OBAMA PLAY?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, the most popular Democrat in America, inserted himself into the 2020 primary in recent days by warning candidates against moving too far to the left. His comments create a challenge for Warren and Sanders and an opening for moderates Buttigieg, Biden and Amy Klobuchar to attack. At the same time, Obama’s involvement offers a powerful reminder of the massive role African Americans will play in the presidential nomination process. As we know, all candidates not named Biden have serious work to do when it comes to winning over the black vote. Race and Obama’s legacy could play a major role in shaping the action.\n\n___\n\nWHAT SAY YOU, IMPEACHMENT JURY?\n\nThey have all come out in favor of impeachment — some more aggressively than others — but it’s noteworthy that five of the 10 Democrats on stage will serve as jurors in the Senate impeachment trial should the House vote to impeach President Donald Trump. It’s a complicated topic for Democrats. Some senators worry that a prospective impeachment trial will interfere with their ability to court voters early next year. Others fear that impeachment could hurt their party’s more vulnerable candidates in down-ballot elections next year. Either way, what the prospective jurors do or don’t say on the debate stage could be relevant if and when the Senate holds an impeachment trial, which is increasingly likely.\n\n___\n\nWILL THEY BASH THE BILLIONAIRES?\n\nNever before has wealth been under such aggressive attack in a presidential primary election. And with one billionaire onstage and another likely to join the field in the coming days, the billionaire bashing could reach new heights. Tom Steyer has largely gone under the radar, but the even wealthier Michael Bloomberg has generated tremendous buzz as he steps toward a run of his own. Of the two, only Steyer will be on stage, but expect Bloomberg’s shadow in particular to generate passionate arguments about wealth and the role of money in politics.\n\n___\n\nWILL SOMEONE STAND UP FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT?\n\nBiden continues to be the favorite of many establishment Democrats, but his underwhelming candidacy has created an opening for another pragmatic-minded Democrat to step up. That’s why former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Bloomberg are moving into the race. Buttigieg stepped aggressively into the establishment lane in the last debate, but many donors and elected officials remain skeptical of the 37-year-old small-city mayor’s chances. The opportunity is there for lower-tier candidates including Kamala Harris, Klobuchar and Steyer.\n\n___\n\nDOES SHE HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT?\n\nNo single issue has dominated the initial Democratic primary debates more than health care, and it’s safe to assume that will be the case again Wednesday night. And no one has more riding on that specific debate than Warren, who hurt herself last month by stumbling through questions about the cost of her single-payer health care plan. Given that policy specifics make up the backbone of her candidacy, she can’t afford another underwhelming performance on the defining policy debate of the primary season. Expect the policy-minded senator to have a new strategy this time around.\n\n___\n\nCAN THEY SAVE THEMSELVES?\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Andrew Yang and Steyer are under enormous pressure to break out given their status as the only candidates onstage who haven’t yet qualified for the December debate. They likely won’t have the same number of opportunities to speak as their higher-polling rivals, but these are dire times for the underdogs. They need to do something if they expect to stay relevant in the 2020 conversation.\n\n___\n\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”\n\nMost Popular\n\n1\n\nThis Bay Area zip code ranks as the most expensive in the country\n\n2\n\nWitness cheered for correcting Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan\n\n3\n\nFor years, people pinned dollar bills to the ceiling of Alameda bar.

The plan also aims to reach module efficiencies of around 24% – up to 35% for multi-junction cells – by the end of the next decade.\n\nNovember 20, 2019 Emiliano Bellini\n\nMarkets\nModules & Upstream Manufacturing\nPolicy\nUtility-scale PV\nSouth Korea\n\nHanwha Q Cells was reportedly South Korea’s largest cell maker at the end of 2017, with 3.7 GW of annual production capacity.\n\nImage: Hanwha Q cells\n\nShare\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has unveiled a plan to help the PV industry further reduce the costs of solar module technology and to increase product efficiency.\n\nThe initiative is part of the Fourth Energy Technology Development Plan and Roadmap, submitted to Korean renewable energy industry representatives this week. The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-fired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind power projects, among other measures.\n\nSixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap include a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10 by 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way of rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in 2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large scale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of Energy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved three years early.\n\nModule efficiency\n\nThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar module efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade. Seoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-junction devices from 23% to 35%.\n\nNo details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would be achieved.\n\nThe plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which aimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency levels and industrial standards for solar and wind power. Those planned guidelines are yet to see the light of day.\n\nDomestic industry\n\nA recent report by the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual production capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had 3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point and LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and modules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production operations ranging from 30-600 MW.\n\nHowever, the reduction in demand seen after Beijing attempted to rein in public solar subsidies at the end of May last year ensures some of that 8.69 GW of Korean production lines may have since been idled or closed altogether.\n\nSouth Korea also hosts several polysilicon manufacturers, including the OCI Group and Hanwha Q Cells parent Hanwha Group. That industry too is suffering from oversupply and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports by the Chinese government since July 2013.\n\nDespite the manufacturing setbacks introduced by its regional neighbor and solar giant, South Korea is seeing stronger than ever solar project deployment. According to data released by MOTIE in August, newly installed capacity for the first seven months of the year reached 1.64 GW and Seoul plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. That ambitious target is expected to be achieved with giant solar parks such as a recently announced 2.1 GW floating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array planned in the Saemangeum area and announced by president Moon Jae-in a year ago.\n\nShare\n\nEmiliano Bellini\n\nEmiliano joined pv magazine in March 2017.

Gostar é sentir com a alma, mas expressar os sentimentos depende das idéias de cada um. Condicionamos o amor às nossas necessidades neuróticas e acabamos com ele. Vivemos uma vida tentando fazer com que os outros se responsabilizem pelas nossas necessidades enquanto nós nos abandonamos irresponsavelmente. Queremos ser amados e não nos amamos, queremos ser compreendidos e não nos compreendemos, queremos o apoio dos outros e damos o nosso a eles. Quando nos abandonamos, queremos achar alguém que venha a preencher o buraco que nós cavamos. A insatisfação, o vazio interior se transformam na busca contínua de novos relacionamentos, cujos resultados frustrantes se repetirão. Cada um é o único responsável pelas suas próprias necessidades.

O pessimismo só faz engessar o sorriso e travar as articulações, não deixa ninguém sair do lugar.

Aqueles que escolhem viver conforme a vontade de Deus e cultivam dentro de si o amor e a bondade inspirados por Sua perfeição são os sábios da Terra. É preciso parar de escolher os caminhos sinuosos com tantas felicidades fingidas e seguir com passos firmes e retos no caminho cheio de luz que Deus já traçou e espera ansiosamente pelo início da sua jornada …\n\nWhatsapp Facebook Pint Baixar\n\nO que une uma família é o amor, o carinho, o querer bem.

(AP)\n\nBreaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening trade war.\n\n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\n\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\n\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump’s tariff decisions.\n\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\n\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer — not richer.\"\n\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\n\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world.\n\nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\n\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\n\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer — say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\n\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\n\nDon’t tariffs produce revenue?\n\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019.\n\nThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\n\nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years.\n\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\n\nAs we’ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\n\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on economic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\n\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\n\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product.\n\nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\n\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed by steel and aluminum in March 2018.\n\nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery, followed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics, more machinery, and electrical equipment.\n\nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018, affecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the list of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes, shoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices.\n\nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including many food products.\n\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a wide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade Partnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington.\n\nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts from tariffs?\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers.\n\nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may have had an impact as well.)\n\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\n\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S. are computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\n\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps, and semiconductors, have seen price increases, harming U.S. producers. \"When the price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete against non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout this article\n\nResearchers: Louis Jacobson\n\nNames in this article: Donald Trump\n\nSources:\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \" The Effects of Tariffs and Trade Barriers in CBO’s Projections,\" Aug. 22, 2019\n\nTax Foundation, \" Tracking the Economic Impact of U.S. Tariffs and Retaliatory Actions,\" May 31, 2019\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics, \" The Cost of Another US-China No-Deal Deal,\" Oct. 15, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Board, \" Beige Book,\" Oct. 16, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, \" Inflationary Effects of Trade Disputes with China,\" Feb. 25, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, CPI historical data, accessed Nov. 5, 2019\n\nCNN, \" China exempts US soybeans and pork from tariffs,\" Sept. 13, 2019\n\nWall Street Journal, \" U.S. Collected $63 Billion in Tariffs Through June,\" Aug. 7, 2019\n\nPolitiFact, \" Donald Trump says tariffs will make America rich again.

The health commission said in a statement that a 55-year old man had contracted bubonic plague after eating a wild rabbit during a hunting trip. The man was subsequently quarantined after the diagnosis, along with 28 people who he came into contact with.\n\nRelated articles\n\nPlague outbreak: China hit by ‘highly contagious’ pneumonic plague\nHorror as plague of killer mosquitos are headed to Britain\n\nHowever, the other 28 people have showed no signs or symptoms of the plague.\n\nThe other two contractors caught pneumonic plague, with the difference being bubonic effects the lymph nodes whereas pneumonic effects the lungs.\n\nFan Mengguang, deputy director of Inner Mongolia’s disease prevention and control centre, told the media that the latest case is “isolated and unrelated” to the cases in Beijing.\n\nHowever, with three confirmed diagnoses, the public is beginning to panic over a potential outbreak.\n\nYersina pestis causes the plague (Image: GETTY)\n\nThe plague wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century (Image: GETTY)\n\nAccording to AFP, one user on Weibo, which is essentially China’s version of Twitter, posted: “I just want to know how these two came to Beijing??

November 18, 2019 12:02 PM\nBy David Jeans\n\nMore than 4,000 people are expected to receive notice in coming weeks (Credit: iStock)\n\nMore than a third of WeWork’s 12,000 employees will likely receive notice this week that they no longer have a job. The layoffs are part of an effort by the struggling office-space company to cut costs, close ancillary businesses and narrow its offering to subletting office space.\n\nWeWork chairman Marcelo Claure (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn a company email sent by chairman Marcelo Claure, employees were told that layoffs will begin this week in the U.S., and that a planned all-hands meeting will be postponed from Tuesday to Friday, where Claure will present the company’s five-year plan.\n\n“In the areas of the business that do not directly support our core business goals, we have to make some necessary job eliminations,” Claure said in the email, which was seen by The Real Deal. “We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities, which will increase efficiency and also accountability.”\n\nA person familiar with the matter told TRD that employees in the legal and human resources departments will begin receiving notice Monday.\n\nWeWork declined to comment.\n\nWeWork employees have waited weeks to hear notice of the layoffs, since the company abandoned plans for an IPO and had its valuation slashed from $47 billion to $8 billion. After CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann left the company in October, SoftBank, its largest investor, committed to a $9.5 billion lifeline to bail out the company, and installed a Claure to implement a turnaround strategy.\n\nIn sum, more than 4,000 people are expected to receive notice in the coming weeks, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n\nThose include 1,000 maintenance workers who have been informed that their employment will be terminated on Dec. 9, according to a group of employees. The group, WeWorkers Coalition, formed in recent weeks and sent a letter to management earlier this month stating that they “don’t want to be defined by the scandals, the corruption and the greed exhibited by the company’s leadership.”\n\nThe group announced over the weekend that WeWork had reached an agreement with JLL to accept close to 1,000 maintenance and cleaning workers, many of whom would then be contracted to work in WeWork buildings.\n\nHowever, the group raised alarm at the terms of the deal, and said that employees were told by WeWork to sign the terms of the contract by Monday, otherwise it would consider their resignations voluntary. The group said on Twitter that the contract has confused employees with pay discrepancies, and demanded a deadline extension.\n\nIn a separate tweet, the group added that WeWork “is not following through on its promise to treat employees with ‘dignity and respect’ during this restructuring process.”\n\nMany employees and shareholders with stock options are also waiting to hear when a $3 billion tender offer by SoftBank will be launched, after being delayed for almost two weeks.\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Linkedin Share via Email Share via Shortlink\nShare via Shortlink\n\nTags\n\nWeWork\n\nPopular\n\nAvery Hall pays $30M for Gowanus site\nStreetEasy hikes rental listing fees, forces manual entry\nA&E Real Estate buys huge rent-stabilized portfolio at deep discount\nKate Spade’s UES co-op sells for $5.8M\nDay in the Life: Frances Katzen\n\nRelated Articles\n\narrow_forward_ios\n\nWendy Silverstein, co-head of WeWork’s real-estate fund, is out\n\nWeWork’s side businesses are fizzling\n\nAnother head rolls at WeWork\n\nNew York AG is investigating WeWork: report\n\nWeWork layoffs loom, de Blasio is skeptical of commercial rent control\n\nPiecing together SoftBank’s disruptive real estate bets\n\nSEC launches WeWork probe: report\n\nSoftBank’s $3B payout to WeWork’s investors is delayed\n\narrow_forward_ios\nAbout Us Contact Us Privacy Policy Subscription Advertising Shop Directory\n\nAll rights reserved © 2019 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.\n\n450 West 31st Street, New York, NY 10001\n\nPhone: 212-260-1332\n\nSign up for T R D news!\n\nEmail Address\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nCompany\nSubscribe\nYou are now subscribed.\nWe are having some technical difficulties.

A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.\n\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\n\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\nRelated: 7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction\n\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\n\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\n\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\n27 Oddest Medical Case Reports\n10 Strangest Medical Cases\n11 Weird Things People Have Swallowed\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n\nWant more science?

By “tasting” the presence of certain pathogens, these cells may act as sentinels for the immune system.\n\nRenderBurger for Quanta Magazine\n\nCarrie Arnold\n\nContributing Writer\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\nbiology cell biology immunology\n\nWhen the immunologist De’Broski Herbert at the University of Pennsylvania looked deep inside the lungs of mice infected with influenza, he thought he was seeing things. He had found a strange-looking cell with a distinctive thatch of projections like dreadlocks atop a pear-shaped body, and it was studded with taste receptors. He recalled that it looked just like a tuft cell — a cell type most often associated with the lining of the intestines.\n\nBut what would a cell covered with taste receptors be doing in the lungs? And why did it only appear there in response to a severe bout of influenza?\n\nHerbert wasn’t alone in his puzzlement over this mysterious and little-studied group of cells that keep turning up in unexpected places, from the thymus (a small gland in the chest where pathogen-fighting T cells mature) to the pancreas. Scientists are only just beginning to understand them, but it is gradually becoming clear that tuft cells are an important hub for the body’s defenses precisely because they can communicate with the immune system and other sets of tissues, and because their taste receptors allow them to identify threats that are still invisible to other immune cells.\n\nResearchers around the world are tracing the ancient evolutionary roots that olfactory and taste receptors (collectively called chemosensory receptors or nutrient receptors) share with the immune system. A flurry of work in recent years shows that their paths cross far more often than anyone anticipated, and that this chemosensory-immunological network plays a role not just in infection, but in cancer and at least a handful of other diseases.\n\nThis system, says Richard Locksley, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, helps direct a systematic response to potential dangers throughout the body. Research focusing on the interactions of the tuft cell could offer a glimpse of how organ systems work together. He describes the prospects of what could come from the studies of these receptors and cells as “exciting,” but cautions that “we’re still in the very early days” of figuring it out.\n\nNot Merely Taste and Smell Receptors\n\nOne of life’s fundamental challenges is to find food that’s good to eat and avoid food that isn’t. Outside of our modern world of prepackaged food on grocery store shelves, it’s a perilous task. Taking advantage of a new type of food could mean the difference between starvation and survival, or it could mean an early death from accidental self-poisoning. Chemosensory receptors help us make this distinction. They’re so essential that even single-celled bacteria such as Escherichia coli carry a type of this receptor.\n\nDespite the near universality of these receptors and their centrality to survival, scientists didn’t discover the big family of genes that encode for olfactory receptors until 1991, with the ones for taste receptors following in 2000. (The olfactory receptor discovery brought the researchers Richard Axel and Linda Buck a Nobel Prize in 2004.) Olfactory receptors and taste receptors for bitter, sweet and umami (savory) are all part of a large family of proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are embedded in cell membranes. Although the precise details vary from receptor to receptor, when a GPCR binds to the proper molecule, it sets off a signaling cascade within the cell. For taste and olfactory receptors in the mouth and nose, this cascade causes neurons to fire and enables us to recognize everything from the rich sweetness of a chocolate chip cookie to the nose-wrinkling stench of a passing skunk.\n\nThe discoveries of these receptors were momentous, groundbreaking advances, says Jennifer Pluznick, a physiologist at Johns Hopkins University. But in her view, labeling them as olfactory and taste receptors rather than as chemosensory receptors entrenched the idea that they function specifically and exclusively in smell and taste. If scientists found signs of these receptors in cells outside the nose and mouth, it was easy to write them off as mistakes or anomalies. She herself was shocked to find an olfactory receptor called Olfr78 in kidney cells, a finding that she reported in 2009.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nSubscribe now\nMost recent newsletter\n\nVideo: In this talk presented at the 2016 TEDMED conference, Jennifer Pluznick, an associate professor of physiology at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the diverse function of the scent detectors found in tissues throughout the body.\n\nTEDMED\n\n“I think I even famously said something to my postdoc adviser, like, ‘I don’t even know that I can trust this data, you know?’” Pluznick recalled. “Olfactory receptors in the kidney? Come on.”\n\nThis wasn’t the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues. For example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-Beechey showed in a paper published in Biochemical Society Transactions that taste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth. Their presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine might use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\n\nBut then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett, who was then at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the airways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they showed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the airways that helped to clear out obstructions.\n\nReceptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In 2012, a research group led by Herbert’s colleague Noam Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activated those receptors and caused the cells to beat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading bacteria and prevent infections.\n\nMeanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the Olfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to molecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that response helped to direct the kidney’s secretion of the hormone renin, which regulates blood pressure. “Other labs finding similar things in other tissues was both very encouraging and very exciting,” Pluznick said.\n\nThese studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove home the message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve important and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those functions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting tissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight, that application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as Herbert notes, being able to “taste” and “smell” minute traces of pathogens gives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm the host’s defenses.\n\nA Job for Tuft Cells\n\nIn researchers’ assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the body, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely unstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since the mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically every organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the pancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn’t led to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery of taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their locations in the body, they certainly weren’t contributing to our sense of taste.\n\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011, Michael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in the intestines. “They were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn’t really have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,” said Howitt, who is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the enigmatic cells’ function, and he eventually got his answer — through an unexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome.\n\nBecause some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune function, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the intestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in the gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard researchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\n\nBut surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from the mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells previously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice carried more protozoa in their guts than expected — specifically, a common single-celled parasite called Tritrichomonas muris.\n\nHowitt realized that T. muris wasn’t an accidental infection but rather a normal part of the microbiome in mice — something that neither he nor Garrett had thought much about. “We weren’t looking for protozoa,” Howitt said. “We were focused on bacteria.”\n\nTo confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the elevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly pathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the protozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft cells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too.\n\nThe numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with parasitic worms. But the increase didn’t happen in mice with defects in the biochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on the tuft cells.\n\nHowitt’s findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for tuft cells in the body’s defenses — one that would fill a conspicuous hole in immunologists’ understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the immune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less about how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and allergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and Garett’s work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their abundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders. If something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune system and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\n\nAt the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von Moltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing in on that finding from another direction by studying some of the chemical signals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of cells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these cytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a chemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark intestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow in their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\n\n“Even textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells did,” he said.\n\nThe Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in Science and Nature, respectively. Together with a third paper in Nature by Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National Center for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies provided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize parasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of parasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the release of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of the defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of mucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the parasites from the gut.\n\nFor the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what tuft cells do. Before this, “people just kind of ignored them or didn’t even realize that they were there,” said Megan Baldridge, a molecular microbiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAs groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal cells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere throughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to roll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate and do more than help repel the body’s invaders. In the thymus (a small globular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft cells help teach the immune system’s maturing T cells the difference between self proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno, now a staff scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells can help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And in Cohen’s studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that recognition of bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by receptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out microbe-killing chemicals.\n\nAs a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert’s at the University of Pennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with interest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with the part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying how tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the flu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to wonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs’ recovery from influenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched the lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\n\nIn a micrograph of lung tissue sampled 25 days after an influenza infection, newly emerging tuft cells are stained yellow/green (at left; a closeup appears at right). Tuft cells don’t normally appear in these airways, but they seem to emerge as part of the body’s response against the infection.\n\nCourtesy of Andrew Vaughan\n\n“Sure enough, they were all over the place,” Vaughan said. But the tuft cells only appeared after influenza infection, which made Vaughan believe that he and Herbert were “basically seeing a cell type where [it’s] not supposed to be.” Although he’s unsure exactly why this proliferation of tuft cells happens after the flu, Vaughan speculates that it might be an aspect of the body’s attempt to repair damage from the virus as part of the broader type 2 immune response.\n\nThe researchers don’t yet know what the tuft cells are doing in the lungs or what they are sensing, but Herbert believes that their ability to continually “taste” the environment for different compounds provides a key opportunity for the body to respond to even minute threats.\n\nThe tuft cell, Herbert said, is constantly sensing the metabolic products present in microenvironments within the body. “Once some of those metabolic products go out of whack … bam! Tuft cells can recognize it and make a response if something is wrong.”\n\nNewly discovered connections between tuft cells and the immune and nervous systems provide further evidence that chemosensory receptors are multipurpose tools like Swiss Army knives, with evolved functions beyond taste and smell. It isn’t clear which function evolved first, though, or whether they all evolved in tandem, Howitt says. Just because scientists became aware of “taste” receptors on the tongue first, “that doesn’t mean that’s the order in which it evolved.”\n\nIn fact, a preliminary study in rats hints that the receptors’ immune functions may have evolved first. Two groups of immune cells known as monocytes and macrophages use formyl peptide receptors on their membranes to detect chemical cues from pathogens, and a group of Swiss scientists showed that rats use these same receptors to detect pheromone odors. Those facts suggest that at some point in history, the ancestors of rats made scent receptors out of the immunological molecules. The evolutionary history of other groups of olfactory and taste receptors has yet to be deciphered.\n\nWhatever their history, scientists now say that a major role of these receptors is to monitor the molecules in our body, tasting and smelling them for any sign that they might be from a pathogen. Then, with help from tuft cells and other parts of the immune system, the body can fight off the invaders before they’ve gotten a foothold. But Vaughan cautioned that the sudden emergence of tuft cells in tissues like the lungs, where they are not always present, might also cause its own pathologies.\n\n“You may not always want to have the ability to [defensively] overreact,” he said. That could be part of what goes wrong in conditions like allergies and asthma: There could be dangers “if you have too many of these cells and they’re too poised to respond to the external environment.”\n\nCorrection added Nov. 18, 2019: The caption below the photograph of Herbert originally made an unconfirmed statement that he was the first to observe the tuft cells in the infected lungs of the mice.\n\nThis article was reprinted on Wired.com.\n\nCarrie Arnold\n\nContributing Writer\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\nbiology cell biology immunology\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nSubscribe now\nMost recent newsletter\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nMost recent newsletter\n\nComment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation.

        "articleBody": "The Space Review: Seeking a bigger role for a big rocket\n\nThe core stage of the first SLS at Michoud Assembly Facility after the installation in early November of its four RS-25 engines. (credit: NASA/Jude Guidry)\n\nSeeking a bigger role for a big rocket\n\nby Jeff Foust\nMonday, November 18, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket’s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\n\n“If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,” Cooke said.\n\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\n\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\n\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s own party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans.\n\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\n\n“While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued.\n\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\n\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke’s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\n\n“If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” Stafford said of returning to the Moon.\n\n“SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,” he continued. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.” He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit—no Gateway required.\n\nAt last week’s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\n\n“The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,” Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke’s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. “I cannot disagree with it.”\n\n“But with eight launches, I’ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,” he concluded.\n\n“Oh my,” Lucas responded with a sigh.\n\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” he said. “You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don’t have it, you’re not going to make it.”\n\nYoung, in his testimony, didn’t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called “experiments” in procurement. “Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,” he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\n\n“A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,” he said. “I personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.”\n\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. “The plate is really full today,” he said. “I personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.”\n\nOne thing Young would push off NASA’s plate is the Gateway. “I do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,” he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. “There’s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.”\n\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”\n\nLast week’s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA’s use—or unwillingness to use—the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\n\n“I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,” he said, including the first Block 1B. “What do you think?”\n\n“It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,” responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn’t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\n“We haven’t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we’re guaranteed the second core we’d need for a Moon landing in 2024,” added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\n\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”\n\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. “What commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?”\n\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman’s OmegA.\n\n“There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,” Bridenstine added. “We’re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.”\n\n“What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,” Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles—or SLS.\n\n“But if commercial’s not available, what’s the contingency plan?” Aderholt asked again.\n\n“I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,” Bridenstine said. “If we don’t have the additional rockets, then we’re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we’re confident we’ll have those rockets.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\n\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke’s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\n“We’re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,” Bridenstine said. “We’re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we’ll assess their approaches.”\n\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\n“Using the lift capability of NASA’s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a ‘Fewest Steps to the Moon’ approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,” Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\n\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the “national team” led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\n\nNASA’s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. José Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\n\n“It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, “in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.”\n\nBabin referred to those comments at last week’s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were ”dwindling.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” he said. “This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.”\n\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA’s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\n\nJeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

We’re on it.’: Spokane ad agencies divided on South Dakota’s viral campaign\n\nUPDATED: Tue., Nov. 19, 2019\n\nMaterials from South Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign. (onmeth.com)\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nEmail\nReddit\nSMS\nBy Megan Rowe meganr@spokesman.com (509) 459-5382\n\nSouth Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” awareness campaign has been facing backlash and mockery since introduced on Monday, but Michelle Hege’s response was concern.\n\nHege is the CEO of DH, the Spokane advertising, public relations and branding firm behind the Washington Healthcare Authority’s Opioid Prevention campaign “Starts with one.”\n\n“I guess my first reaction was, ‘Oh no, they’re going to get a lot of attention and, maybe, not all of it helpful attention,’ ” Hege said. “At the end of the day, the proof’s in the pudding. I’m sure they’ve got a good evaluation plan in place to look at results over time, but I did feel concerned that it may just create noise that doesn’t actually drive the behaviors that they’re looking to drive.”\n\nWhen developing the “Starts with one” campaign – which will be in its third year in January – DH did extensive research into the targeted audiences, working with them directly to understand their knowledge, beliefs and values regarding opioid misuse. Selling a product is difficult, but altering behavior is much more difficult, Hege said.\n\n“It’s difficult to change people’s behaviors, but this is also some of the most important advertising and communications work that’s out there,” Hege said. “This is our favorite kind of work to do because it’s a way to make a positive impact in the world.”\n\nWhile the “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham, Washington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she did not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful for its audience.\n\n“When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can either be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that’s not intended to see it,” Graham said.\n\nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that encouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive screenings.\n\n“You might need to have a message that’s very unique to the population that might be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt like it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might have a little edgier message,” Graham said. “If somebody from the general public saw it, they might think, ‘Wow this is a little over the edge’ or they might think, ‘Why are they putting it here?’ It’s because it’s meant for a specific population.”\n\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering the example of a recent domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\n“We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on gaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that’s where a lot of young men were spending more time,” Graham said. “It can seem like there’s a thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might be looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very audience-centric.”\n\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising and design agency, said he thought South Dakota’s campaign – run by a Minneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 – was meant to raise eyebrows.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the dining table of the company’s kitchen, where he posts new marketing findings and other things for members of his firm to ponder.\n\n“OK, great, let’s be provocative, let’s get people to notice it and talk about it, but I don’t think people are talking about it in the way that you want them talking about it, right?” Sanborn said. “What’s America talking about? South Dakota’s got a meth problem, so that’s not the best thing for the South Dakota brand.”\n\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That message is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and “we want to try to help,” Sanborn said.\n\n“The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they’ll put the heart of their message somewhere deep in their third paragraph,” Sanborn said. “If that’s the core and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that everybody in America reads.”\n\nWordcount: 717\nPublished: Nov. 19, 2019, 6:18 p.m. Updated: Nov. 19, 2019, 7:10 p.m.\nTags: ads, advertisement, awareness, meth, methamphetamine, nation, news, south dakota\n\nSubscribe to the Morning Review newsletter\n\nGet the day’s top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning by subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nYou have been successfully subscribed!\nThere was a problem subscribing you to the newsletter.

JOSEPH, Mich. (AP) — Michigan health authorities are reporting a 6th fatality linked to Eastern Equine Encephalitis.\n\nBerrien County Health Department officials said Monday the victim was one of two people who contracted the mosquito borne virus. The death occurred Saturday.\n\nCases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis first appeared in West Michigan at the end of August. The virus has been reported in Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo and Van Buren counties. The outbreak has resulted in 10 human cases and 46 animal cases.\n\nDr. Joneigh Khaldun of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services says the risk from the virus continues because there hasn’t been a sustained period of freezing temperatures. He says residents in the affected areas should continue to take precautions against mosquito bites.\n\n© 2019 Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The five companies can now vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\n\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We anticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology payloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance our goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\n\nRelated: SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Mars Rocket in Pictures\n\nThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018, bringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\n\nThe newly selected five are:\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nNASA has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems to build the private moon landers needed to help return astronauts to the moon in 2024.\n(Image credit: Future/SpaceX/Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada)\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nAn artist's concept of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander.\n(Image credit: Blue Origin)\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nThis Sierra Nevada Corp. illustration shows a concept of the company's commercial lunar lander for NASA.\n(Image credit: Sierra Nevada Corp.)\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nAn artist's concept of a Ceres Robotics moon lander and lunar rover on the moon's surface.\n(Image credit: Ceres Robotics)\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nThis illustration shows a concept moon lander by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.\n(Image credit: Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.)\n\nBlue Origin, Kent, Washington\nCeres Robotics, Palo Alto, California\nSierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, Colorado\nSpaceX, Hawthorne, California\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, California\n\nThey include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly massive — SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle — to land multiple rovers on the moon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems.\n\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of private industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we’ll expand our ability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and support human exploration objectives.\"\n\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which the company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\n\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that could potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\n\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to deliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power stations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\n\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through November 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the program can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\" Clarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to really broaden the pool — to bring on additional capabilities with new, innovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\n\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding lander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond. Orbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on future opportunities.\n\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new technology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do much more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our commercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the statement.\n\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by 2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by 2028.\n\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on Mars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have stressed.\n\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers. This past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build prototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the Artemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early next year.\n\nMoon Rush: Private Lunar Lander Plans\nHere's Where Commercial Landers Will Land on the Moon for NASA\nNASA: The International Space Station Is Open for Business in Orbit\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated at 5:45 p.m. ET to include details from the NASA telecon.\n\nEmail Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him @tariqjmalik.

Why it’s crucial, actually!\n\nIf we haven’t met yet, my name is Pamela Wilson — and I have been working online since 2010.\n\nI’m a three-time author, a keynote speaker, and an online educator, coach, and mastermind group leader.\n\nI help people build online businesses they love.\n\nIn this article, and in the coming weeks, I’m sharing my approach to online business growth.\n\nIt was born from helping thousands of people create the online presence they’ve dreamt of — and seeing way too many of them lose focus and struggle to get any results at all.\n\nOnce you understand my simple approach, you’ll feel much better about where you are in the online business growth process — and that’s a promise.\n\nHow can I promise you’re about to feel better?\n\nBecause once you understand my approach …\n\nYou’ll recognize you don’t have to master everything about online business all at once\nYour to-do list will shrink to 25% of its current size\nYou’ll be able to safely ignore 75% of the online information you’re seeing right now\n\nGet ready to start enjoying the process of building your online business — maybe for the first time ever!\n\nIf you are …\n\nTrying to build an online business because you have deep expertise on a specific topic — but you’re “on hold” because you’re feeling overwhelmed\nWanting to leave a legacy of information and guidance around a topic you’re passionate about — but you don’t know where to start\nPassionate about the business idea you’ve imagined — but unsure about how to make it happen\n\n… stick around. What you’re about to read is critical information that could change the course of your life.\n\nReally.\n\nHow to maintain a business focus the easy way\n\nThe goal of this series of articles is to help you steadily build the online business you have in mind right now — without ever feeling lost and overwhelmed.\n\nYou’re about to feel the relief that comes from having a clear business focus.\n\nYou’ll understand what matters now — and what you can ignore.\n\nThis is the key to making steady progress as you build your online presence!\n\nA genius approach to online business building?\n\nNot to get too Albert Einstein on you, but …\n\nEvery online business exists in the 'space-time continuum.' Click To Tweet\n\nThink about it:\n\nYou build your website in its own little corner of the internet\nSearch engines find it at the moment in time that it goes live\nPeople begin to discover and use it\nYour relationship with the people you attract grows person-by-person and day-by-day\n\nThe faster you can create an online business that exists in both space and time, the faster these benefits will accrue:\n\nSearch engines will drive people to your information\nYou’ll go from imagining the people you want to serve to serving real people\nYour email list will begin to grow\nYour products and services will all benefit from the interaction\nYour revenues and impact will grow year-by-year\n\nAre you ready to make this happen?\n\nHow to avoid falling for every online pitch you see\n\nBefore we start, I’ve got to warn you about something that’s critically important. Not paying attention to this will virtually guarantee that you will stay stuck where you are.\n\nAnd you’ll have a lot less money in your bank account.\n\nHere’s the thing …\n\nWhen you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of characters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.\n\nI'm here to tell you that the Laws of Physics apply to online business just like offline business. Click To Tweet\n\nIt takes time to build a successful business — offline and online.\n\n(I know, radical statement, right?)\n\nI want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get time on your side.\n\nTrying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would have you believe. It has its challenges.\n\nThere’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a lot of marketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with.\n\nAnd there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs to interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.\n\nToday, I’m going to demystify the process of building your online business.\n\nYou’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it turns out your don’t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online.\n\nI developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error — mine, and the people I taught.\n\nIt’s called Plan & Grow BIG.\n\nFocus on what really matters in the near future of your business\n\nPlan & Grow BIG helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business.\n\nMaybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying for years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t living up to what you expected.\n\nEither way, you’re in the right place because today’s information will help you catapult forward.\n\nI developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to master.\n\nFor example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads — before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer.\n\nAnd I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.)\n\nI saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁\n\nSmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this “online business thing.”\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself.\n\nTrue confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way\n\nBefore I outline the Plan & Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.\n\nI’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.\n\nBack in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design.\n\nI had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their “launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers.\n\nI didn’t have a lot of time to spare.\n\nPlus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video.\n\nYikes.\n\nAnd although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t making a single cent.\n\nWho in their right mind invests in a business idea before they know if it will make money?\n\nI do, apparently!\n\nIt turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.\n\nBecause I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.\n\nBut I’m glad I did.\n\nI truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, “This dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I’m taking this seriously.”\n\nOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me.\n\nWithin a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.\n\nThen another article went live. And another.\n\nNot just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day.\n\nAnd through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching.\n\nOut with the old, in with the new (and better)\n\nWithin a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts.\n\nNow, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence.\n\nThat company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years.\n\nHere’s what’s different in my life now:\n\nMy business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)\nI am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me\nMy books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single month\nPeople find my website and join my community every day, all year long\nI’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpack\nI can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule\n\nHere’s the other important thing …\n\nI also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer to no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs whenever I’d like.\n\nBut this story isn’t about me.\n\nWhat I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what truly works online.\n\nIt’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A business where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings.\n\nAnd that’s what I want for you.\n\nReady to make online business building easier?\n\nYou wouldn’t have read this far if you didn’t also want to build this kind of online business!\n\nThat’s why I want to make it easier for you.\n\nWhat is your business focus right now?\n\nIf you can’t answer that question immediately, read on.\n\nHow to use Plan & Grow BIG to get the business focus mindset you need\n\nThe purpose of the Plan & Grow BIG approach is to help you develop business focus — and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from making progress.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI believe the #1 enemy of online progress is the flood of information about online business tactics that bombards us every day. Click To Tweet\n\nI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!\n\nAnd how developing business focus will allow you to build the business you’re dreaming about much faster — and with less frustration.\n\nTo get started, I created a simple quiz and resource doc that will help you get more value from this article.\n\nGrab my 12-question quiz that will help you pinpoint the stage you’re in right now — and get guidance about how to maximize your results.\n\nGET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!\n\nClick the link above so you can:\n\nDiscover what business-building stage you’re in now\nAssess what you’re starting with — make a list of your current assets\nPinpoint what your current business focus should be\nGet to know what happens in the other business stages — so you can focus\n\nDownload it here so you can apply this to your business:\n\nGET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!\n\nAs we go through each stage of the Plan & Grow BIG approach, I want you to identify areas of opportunity for your current situation.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nThe four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIG\n\nThe Plan Stage: Think and dream productively\n\nIt’s the early days of your business.\n\nThink BIG. And work only on what’s needed in this stage.\n\nIn the PLAN stage, make these your business focus:\n\nPinpoint your ideal customer: Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step — don’t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers.\nGet your branding in place: The earlier the better when it comes to\nbuilding your brand. You’ll want to decide your business name and\ntagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts.\nMap out your first offer: Decide how what solutions you’ll deliver and how you’ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?\n\nThat’s it. Once you’ve completed the items above, it’s time to start building your business, my friend. Ready?\n\nThe Build Stage: Create a tangible online asset\n\nTime to make ideas real. As you build these tangible business assets, remember: you don’t have to do it all at once.\n\nFocus on these business goals during the BUILD stage:\n\nBuild your initial website: You’ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of “commerce” page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.\nBuild your first offer: Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.\nBuild an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.\n\nAnd now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have to catch up to them.\n\nNonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you’re ready to move on …\n\nThe Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works\n\nOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable.\n\nBut growth usually does feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it?\n\nThe IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s what you’ll focus on while you’re there:\n\nMake your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.\nFocus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network.\nDiscover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.\n\nRemember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend!\n\nBut once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for …\n\nThe Grow Stage: Leverage your success\n\nIn the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success.\n\nImprove your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.\nAdd more revenue streams: As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.\n\nThe GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business.\n\nReady? Set? Business focus!\n\nNow that you know your business stage (you DID download the quiz, right?), you can tap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. Ignore all the techniques you’ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the stage you’re in.\n\nGet the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist of all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.\n\nWhen you do this, you can count on steady business growth — with less frustration and more confidence because you’re focused on the right thing at the right time.\n\nThe next BIG challenge is …\n\nNow that you’re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate frustration and make faster progress, here’s the next big online business challenge …\n\nBecoming a “visible” and public leader in your space.\n\nThis was a HUGE stumbling block for me.\n\nIn the next article, I’m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you become more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader. Once you embrace the increased visibility that comes with building an online business, you’ll see all sorts of interesting doors open up.\n\nYour go-forward plan for business focus\n\nThe BIG question is, how do you successfully shape an online business dream into a viable online business that gives you the income, freedom, and recognition you deserve?\n\nIt comes down to business focus. Which is easy once you know what to focus on, and what to ignore.\n\nOnce you’ve built that business, you have to stand out in front of it and represent it in your marketing, on social media, and at in-person events.\n\nIf you don’t master this, you’ll severely limit your reach and your impact. So how do you get comfortable with this increased visibility?\n\nHow can you step up and embrace the “internet limelight?” Because once you do, online doors will open for you!\n\nRead about that topic in the next article in this series, How to Adopt an Online Leader Success Mindset.\n\nPamela Wilsonbigbrandsystem\n\n258 Shares\nBuffer\nShare\nPin\nTweet\nShare\nEmail\n\nCreating Offers, Online Business\nbusiness journey\n\nPamela Wilson\n\nPamela Wilson is an online educator, author, keynote speaker, and the founder of BIG Brand System.

You’re pretty awesome yourself — I’m glad our paths have crossed. 🙂\n\nJan Smith\nAugust 8, 2018 at 7:21 pm\n\nHi, Pamela, I am a guy in his mid-70’s who has had 2 financial disasters. I spent all savings (including all retirement $) just to survive. That said, I’m having the time of my life right now by helping others to conquer fear, worry, doubt panic, etc. by applying wisdom from the Bible that God has patiently poured into me. The comments I receive from readers is so astonishing to me! I never started out to do anything like that.\nBlog articles are free for anyone to read, but I do have two online courses that bundle together articles from the blog with some new content. The income pays for secure web hosting, and list-building technology.\nWhat I’m wondering is: given that my focus is more on being helpful than on getting the money, I don’t see that as being consistent with the focus of every purveyor of online “how to sell, sell, sell” focus.\nSo, how would your plan help someone like me, given that I have no extra money and will not go into debt to buy whatever you are selling?\n\nPamela Wilson\nAugust 8, 2018 at 7:34 pm\n\nI’m really glad to hear you’ve found a way to serve that feels really good to you, Jan.\n\nI offer free information every single month here on the blog. I host free in-depth workshops every month, too.\n\nIf you feel like buying something, you can get my 99 cent Kindle book! And if you really want to splurge, you can get Master Content Marketing for well under $20.\n\nThere’s absolutely no need take on debt to learn around here — I hope you find it helpful.\n\nAnita DeSousa\nAugust 10, 2018 at 9:40 am\n\nEnjoyed your article, focus is extremely important to be successful with anything!\n\nI have many ideas floating around just not sure how to make a go of it with an online business or if that is even the right thing for me. 🤔\n\nWill continue to read articles and learn, so it will not be so overwhelming when I can “focus” and do it right.\n\nUntil then just juggling 🤹‍♀️\n\nPamela Wilson\nAugust 10, 2018 at 9:51 am\n\nAnita, it’s so good to see you here! That “ideas floating around” challenge is something every entrepreneur I know has to deal with. I hope you find some clarity on these pages. 🙂\n\nYvonne DiVita\nAugust 11, 2018 at 9:51 am\n\nI relate to the ” you can spend a lot of money on a lot of things and get nowhere” idea. So many people are out there pitching us. I get so many invitations to build a better business, using this advice or that. And, it’s always the same.\n\nExcept here. You are unique. Your approach is so focused, it’s almost funny… because, why can’t we figure all that out? I know the answer… the answer is – because we are bombarded with content that purports to have the answer and we spend too much time trying to do things the way someone else wants us to. The answer is not in someone else’s head.\n\nThe answer is in us…however, the journey we travel along, needs guidance and sherpas. Like you.\n\nPamela Wilson\nAugust 11, 2018 at 11:35 am\n\n“The answer is not in someone else’s head.”\n\nAmen, sister: preach!!!\n\nTom Collins\nAugust 11, 2018 at 10:41 am\n\nHi Pamela, so excited to see this new iteration of your wisdom! Your timing is great for me.\n\nAs you’ll recall, I was deep into your Build stage, about ready to start Implementing, months ago — when we made the sudden (unexpected, to me) decision to move back across the country from CO to upstate NY. Which threw me back into your “on hold” status, business-wise. After “implementing” the decision to move, I’ve been literally building things (deck, fence, french doors and windows, kitchen remodel, etc.) to get us settled into the new digs!\n\nBut by this fall I’ll be diving back into my business work and can’t wait to apply your always-helpful tips!\n\nTHANKS!\n\nPamela Wilson\nAugust 11, 2018 at 11:34 am\n\nSo good to see you here, Tom. Life gets in the way sometimes, doesn’t it?

        "articleBody": "Prison guards charged in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's death\n\nWelcome to USA TODAY NETWORK’S EUROPEAN UNION EXPERIENCE\n\nLearn More\n\nTwo federal prison officers charged with falsifying records in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's suicide\n\nKevin Johnson and Kevin McCoy USA TODAY\nPublished 7:07 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nWASHINGTON – Two federal prison officers were charged Tuesday with falsifying records, stating they had checked on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in the hours before he hanged himself in his Manhattan cell.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, assigned to Epstein's special housing unit at Metropolitan Correctional Center, \"browsed the Internet,\" lingered in an office common area and appeared to sleep for two hours when they should have been conducting inmate checks.\n\nNoel and Thomas signed \"false certifications\" attesting they had made their required rounds, according to court records.\n\nProsecutors alleged that no inmate checks were made from 10:30 p.m. Aug. 9 to 6:30 a.m. the following morning, when the officers discovered Epstein's body. During that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents.\n\n“As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records. Noel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\n\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\n\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations at the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\nIndictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this.\n\n\"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,” Sasse said.\n\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\n\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports anything other than suicide.\n\nInternal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts\n\nInvestigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself with a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\n\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned to Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\n\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our hope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n\n“We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,” Figgins said.\n\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n\nPrisons plagued by understaffing\n\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised security at the Manhattan facility.\n\nStaffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union. Prison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, the one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\n\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\n\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s trust in us.”\n\nEpstein's inner circle eyed: Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\nThis March 28, 2017, file photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein.\nNew York State Sex Offender Registry via AP\n\nEpstein removed from suicide watch\n\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\n\nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n“When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\n\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\n\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.”\n\nContributing: Kristine Phillips\n\nPublished 7:07 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n© Copyright Gannett 2018"

Ascom’s Unite Connect for clinical systems recently received FDA clearance for sales and distribution in the US. It is also available in Canada.\n\nThe joint clinical alarm management solution extends the reach of patient alarms generated by Dräger’s patient monitoring system to mobile caregivers. The alert message provides critical data and related contextual information right to the caregiver’s mobile device. The mobile delivery of waveform images adds a contextual dimension by helping increase awareness of the patient’s condition and helping nurses distinguish between artifacts, false alarms, and real alarms. Patients benefit from quicker response times to events.\n\nAlready in use at European hospitals in France, Belgium and Norway, Ascom’s Unite Connect for clinical systems is a software application utilizing customizable alarm filters to help minimize non-actionable alerts which can cause workflow bottlenecks. Nurses can then focus more effectively on patient care rather than responding to alerts that do not require action. These alert notification messages are intended as a secondary notification system to inform caregivers of patient events captured by these clinical systems and do not replace the primary alarm functions on the monitors.\n\nSteve Menet, Senior Vice President of Sales for Dräger, Inc., says: “Effective clinical alarm management continues to be a high focus for health systems and hospitals. As the use of mobile technologies expands in healthcare, so does the opportunity to extend alarm management to mobile caregivers. Our new solution with Ascom provides customers the opportunity to communicate actionable patient information from our Infinity patient monitoring systems to clinicians, while filtering out nuisance alarms that contribute to alarm fatigue.”\n\nRob Goldman, President Ascom North America, says: “By collaborating with Dräger, Ascom can help hospitals supplement and enhance their alarm management solutions. Leveraging Unite Connect for clinical systems’ customizable alarm filtering helps mobile caregivers avoid unnecessary work interruptions, limiting their exposure to low-priority, routine alerts and helping reduce caregiver alarm fatigue.”\n\nAscom is a global solutions provider focused on healthcare ICT and mobile workflow solutions. The vision of Ascom is to close digital information gaps allowing for the best possible decisions – anytime and anywhere. Ascom’s mission is to provide mission-critical, real-time solutions for highly mobile, ad hoc, and time-sensitive environments.

But another one, in the United States, has barely begun.\n\nThe Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from Sweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was dragged out by British police.\n\nNow Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face decades in jail.\n\nFrom behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case. The decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing extradition request to the one from the US.\n\nWhat was the Swedish investigation about?\n\nAssange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual.\n\nHe also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish move to drop the investigation.\n\nWikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: \"Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.\"\n\nWhat charges does Assange face in the US?\n\nAustralian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US.\n\nHe is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.\n\nHow likely is an Assange conviction in US?\n\nIn June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an extradition request from the US.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\nImage caption Assange gestures with a thumbs up after he was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London\n\nAssange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving the custody period of his jail term.\n\nBut a judge ruled that Assange should remain in jail until his extradition hearing because of his \"history of absconding\".\n\nLast month, a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition hearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London in February.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nSweden\nWikileaks\nUnited States\nJulian Assange\n\nShare this story About sharing\n\nEmail\nFacebook\nMessenger\nMessenger\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\n\nMore on this story\n\nVideo Julian Assange dragged from Ecuadorean embassy\n11 April 2019\nVideo 'Misrule of law': Pamela Anderson's jail visit to Julian Assange\n7 May 2019\nJulian Assange doesn't consent to US extradition, court hears\n2 May 2019\nJulian Assange: Campaigner or attention seeker?\n19 November 2019\nJulian Assange: Why is the Wikileaks co-founder a wanted man?\n12 April 2019\n\nTop Stories\n\nWave of Israeli strikes hit Iran's forces in Syria\n\nIsrael's military says the strikes inside Syria were in response to rockets fired by Iranian troops.\n\n20 November 2019\nFormer UK consulate worker says China tortured him\n20 November 2019\nSuspect in Malta journalist murder held on yacht\n20 November 2019\n\nFeatures\n\nHow a vote in Ethiopia could test Nobel prize winner\n\nVideo\n\nMeet the women on a mission to clear landmines\n\nVideo\n\nThree tips to win an election debate\n\nWhy do billions of people still not have glasses?\n\nHow to buy an Instagram following\n\nAmazon gets closer to getting Alexa everywhere\n\nZimbabwe - the land where cash barons thrive\n\nVideo\n\nSucking up CO2 from one of the world's worst emitters\n\nBBC Future: The race to escape Arctic sea ice\n\nElsewhere on the BBC\n\nLyrics quiz\n\nHave you been getting these songs wrong?\n\nFull article Lyrics quiz\n\nFeeling hot\n\nWhat happens to your body in extreme heat?\n\nFull article Feeling hot\nWhy you can trust BBC News\n\nBBC News Navigation\n\nWorld Sections\n\nAfrica\nAsia\nAustralia\nEurope selected\nLatin America\nMiddle East\nUS & Canada\n\nHome\nVideo\nWorld selected\n\nWorld Home\nAfrica\nAsia\nAustralia\nEurope selected\nLatin America\nMiddle East\nUS & Canada\n\nUK\n\nUK Home\nEngland\nN.

Тогда трудно было найти журнал, на страницах которого не было бы фотографий Полины. Затем девушка подалась в мир кино. Она снималась у многих режиссеров (например, у Кустурицы в «Аризонской мечте»), а ее партнерами по фильмам становились Джонни Депп и Микки Рурк.\n\nСейчас Полине исполнилось 53 года, и хоть выглядит она до сих пор на все сто, ее охватила настоящая паника.\n\nРазве этой красотке дашь 53 года?\n\nФото\n@paulinaporizkov\n\nВ интервью модель призналась, что жутко боится старости. «Когда вся ваша жизнь состояла в том, чтобы выглядеть хорошо, стареть публично – это ужасно. Это не для слабонервных, – пожаловалась Поризкова. — Я постоянно борюсь с собой, внутренне говоря: «Да ладно, красота не так уж важна! Отпусти ее и сосредоточься больше на том, что еще можно сделать!»\n\nНо пока у модели это не получается. Она откровенно рассказала, что, хоть пока и не колола ботокс, постоянно прибегает к тем или иным процедурам красоты, чтобы сохранить молодость как можно дольше, и тратит на это почти все свободное время.\n\n«Я лично ненавижу, когда вижу, что кто-то сделал и пластику, и уколы для сохранения красоты, но они утверждают, что причина, по которой они так хорошо выглядят, – это йога и вода. Сразу понятно, что они врут».\n\nБывшая супермодель призналась, что боится: люди высмеивают то, как она выглядит сейчас. «Я думаю, что кто-то сейчас скажет: эй, посмотри на эту красивую женщину, которая превратилась в эту отвратительную старуху».\n\nНо нам кажется, Поризкова слегка лукавит. Старухой ее назвать ни у кого язык не повернется. Полина до сих пор позирует для глянцевых журналов и выглядит лучше многих молодых моделей. Между прочим, некоторые фотосеты весьма провокационны. Например, она приняла участие в проекте для модного издания. Вместо одежды на телах моделей были лишь надписи, отражавшие самые важные для них ценности. Поризкова выбрала слово «Правда».\n\nДа и муж Полины до сих пор просто обожает ее. Поризкова и музыкант Рик Оказек поженились еще на заре ее карьеры и уже почти 30 лет счастливы в браке. Да и кто бы не гордился такой красавицей-женой!\n\nМатериалы по теме\n\nКак молоды мы были: звездные пары в начале отношений и сейчас\nУгадайте, кто.

In the end, we will win and save our Country from certain destruction,” Trump tweeted soon after the House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.\n\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, another top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\n\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats’ central allegation in this impeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\n“Specifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no indication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating his previous deposition testimony that ‘there was no linkage like that,\" she said.\n\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the Democrats.\n\n“With the Democrats’ poll-tested ‘quid-pro-quo’ and ‘bribery’ narratives in shambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for one more second,” Grisham said.\n\n“We have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate ‘impeachment’ proceedings. However, buried among the witnesses’ personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was ‘accurate’ and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to ‘bribery’ or any other crime,” she added.\n\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for President Trump.\n\n“Today's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election,” Grisham said.\n\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump’s request to Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\n\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with American national security goals.\n\n“Frankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security,” Vindman said.\n\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\n“I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different than other calls I had listened to,” she said.\n\n“I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,” Williams said.\n\n“I can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,” she said in response to a question.\n\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be pursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\n“We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't think pursuing these things serves a national interest,” Volker said.\n\nDH Newsletter Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\nGET IT\nDonald Trump\nWhite House\nUkraine\nUSA\n0 Comments (+)\n\nRelated stories\n\nBeijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\n150 Indians deported from US land at Delhi airport...\n\nDiehards remain at HK campus as foreign pressure grows...\n\nUS, China fossil fuel polluters far off climate targets...\n\n'Climate impacts to cost world $7.9 trillion by 2050'...\n\nOil prices steady after 2-day drop amid growth concerns...\n\nDH Picks\n\nPSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr...\n\nKarnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n\nKPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams...\n\nBullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n\nSocial audits key to finding issues in govt schemes...\n\nsocial feed\n\nWhat does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\nPolitics\nNorth and Central\nSouth\nEast and Northeast\nWest\n\nKarnataka\n\nTop Stories\nPolitics\nDistricts\n\nBengaluru\n\nTop Stories\nBengaluru Crime\nPolitics\nInfrastructure\nLife in the City\n\nSports\n\nCricket\nICC World Cup 2019\nFormula 1 with DH\nFootball\nTennis\nSportscene\nOther Sports\n\nBusiness\n\nBusiness News\nBudget 2019\nEconomy & Business\nFamily Finance\nTechnology\nDH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\nVideos\nPhotos\n\nOpinion\n\nDH Views\nEditorials\nPanorama\nComment\nIn Perspective\nRight in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\nEntertainment News\nDH Talkies\nArts, Books & Culture\n\nMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\nKarnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\nIndia vs Bangladesh\n\nChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\nAyodhya verdict\n\nPegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\nDH Picks\n\nPSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep\nKarnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\nKPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\nBullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\nSocial audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\nLatest stories\n\nPawar meets Modi, briefs on farm crisis in Maharashtra\nA Dhankhar-shaped question around the role of governors\nDon't mix politics and security to leaders: Cong in RS\nVodafone Idea, Airtel rally for 4th consecutive season\nRIL market cap inches closer to Rs 10 lakh crore\n\nTrending news\n\nIrked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\nAnil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\nTech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\nStents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\nGunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\nServices\n\nAbout\nEpaper\nNewsletter\nArchives\nSitemap\nClassifieds\nContact\n\nOur group sites\n\nPrinters Mysore\nPrajavani\nSudha\nMayura\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms\nDisclaimer\n\n© 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\nX Share via\n\nShare permalink\n\nWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

I am totally that person for my family when it comes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store gift cards and another HomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart speakers aren’t always the right gift.\n\nThat’s why I’m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different. Last year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home products, and most of those picks are still applicable.\n\nBut there’s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I’ve received for testing — new technology that I’m super glad to see exist. Read on to see my favorite picks for new tech that I’m grateful for this year.\n\nSatechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\n\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C on MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple laptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook would struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs. A better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage, and now it’s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit while charging in the car.\n\nSatechi’s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I’ve tested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It features two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you charge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro — even during use.\n\nIt’s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I’m still amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro when just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery percentage while charging.\n\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and another with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from Satechi.\n\nRAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\n\nIt’s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year — not in terms of power delivery but in miniaturization.\n\nThanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and reliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than what Apple includes in the box.\n\nRAVPower’s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I’ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away from owning a third.\n\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact that it’s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple’s chargers pleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials USB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\n\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my top tech discoveries this year.\n\nMophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\n\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat project first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to fill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nWhile no one has matched Apple’s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless charging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that stands out.\n\nMophie’s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot for charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, and iPhone 8 or later. It’s not cheap at $140, but it’s very nice to own and makes for a great gift.\n\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a couple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my nightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\n\nPrior to Mophie’s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad’s version (pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience, but I prefer the tighter design of Mophie’s personally. If you don’t need the Apple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless charging mat with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for $60 less.\n\nEven with Apple’s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward this year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods, Apple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless charger on my nightstand.\n\nSamsung 4K Smart LED TV\n\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn’t expect to ever include a Samsung TV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple introduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\n\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending audio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\n\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and even watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple TV Channels.\n\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed over to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try. That turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for $278.\n\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200 before you factor the cost of a new TV.\n\nI’ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since AirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly recommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room without spending a fortune.\n\nLinksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\n\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\n\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this year. Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than 802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take advantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery between multiple mesh routers).\n\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we’re sure to see more Apple hardware join next year.\n\nIf you’re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to treat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a future pick this year that you can buy now.\n\nI’ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400, currently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and early results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as your tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\n\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh bang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-pack.\n\nLogitech MX Master 3 Mouse\n\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse that came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek part.\n\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn’t want to buy the same mouse again only to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much that I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was somehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\n\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed $99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside the $99 Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great pair.\n\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and charge over USB-C (Apple’s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same charger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX Master 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys wireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard.\n\nThen there’s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse and keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro and my iPad Pro, and switching between which device I’m using is as easy as a button press. Highly recommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro even further.\n\nBrydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\n\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing board with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\n\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned keyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it’s not the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in my house.\n\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her 12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age — even after a keyboard repair.\n\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for myself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio. iPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible for her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt to her.\n\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth, backlit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard case. I haven’t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129, regular $149) since the day she got it.\n\nIt may not be for me, but it’s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case among former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\n\nLooking for more gift recommendations?

Tell us what you think about our new look by taking this survey.\n\nGive Feedback\nMost Popular\n\nFire damages Fort Orange Club in Albany\nBest of the Capital Region 2019: Pizza\nPhotos: Crossgates Mall through the years\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Pacific Gas & Electric Co. was set to begin shutting off power Wednesday to some 375,000 people in 18 Northern and central California counties as the region faces extreme fire weather that’s lasted since October.\n\nA virtually rainless fall has left brush bone-dry and forecasts called for low humidity and winds gusting at times to 55 mph (88.5 kph), which might fling tree branches or other debris into power lines, causing sparks that could set catastrophic fires in the region, PG&E officials said.\n\nOne Napa County reporting station hasn’t seen a measurable drop of rain since mid-September — the first time that’s happened since 1905, said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's principal meteorologist.\n\nThe northern Sierra Nevada has seen a fraction of an inch of rain in the past two months instead of the usual 5 inches (127 millimeters), he said.\n\n“This lack of rain is keeping the threat of fire very real, this late in the season, in many areas,” said Scott Strenfel, PG&E's principal meteorologist.\n\nIronically, the dry weather up north came as Southern California battened the hatches for a brief but fierce bout of rain. A storm system dumped about 2 inches (50.8 millimeters) of rain in the San Diego County area on Tuesday and more was expected Wednesday.\n\nFlash flood watches were in effect for some communities east of Los Angeles, with storm warnings up for mountain communities.\n\nVoluntary evacuation warnings were issued for a few communities in an area of Orange and Riverside counties that was burned in a wildfire last year.\n\nIn the north, however, warnings of extreme fire danger covered a large area.\n\nCalifornia’s state fire agency placed fire engines and crews in position in some counties and had crews ready to staff aircraft and bulldozers.\n\nThe planned blackouts will affect counties north of Sacramento, in the northern San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country and Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nThe weather should ease by Thursday morning, allowing PG&E to begin restoring power, said Mark Quinlan, PG&E's senior director of emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe state’s largest utility decreased the number of people who could be affected from an original estimate of about 660,000 based on updated forecasts and some juggling of its power system. The utility said it will closely monitor the weather and could further reduce that number if it improves.\n\nThe planned blackout would be the latest in a series of massive outages by the country’s largest utility, including one last month that affected nearly 2.5 million people and outraged local officials and customers who accused the utility of overkill and using blackouts as a crutch because it failed to harden its equipment to withstand fire weather.\n\nThe outages have been “terribly disruptive” and PG&E is taking steps to avoid them in the future but at the moment, “we won’t roll the dice on public safety,” company CEO Andy Vesey said.\n\nMeanwhile, California’s utilities regulators are demanding answers from wireless providers whose equipment failed during the power outages, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without a way to get emergency alerts or make 911 calls.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission holds a public hearing Wednesday with executives from AT&T, Comcast/Xfinity, T-Mobile and others.\n\nIn a letter calling for the meeting, CPUC President Marybel Batjer said that “lack of service is not a mere inconvenience— it endangers lives.” She said residents do not have the luxury of failed internet or cellphone connections during a wildfire or other disaster.\n\nPG&E initiated four rounds of planned outages in October.\n\nMore than 450,000 people were without communication, according to a group representing rural counties in California. About half of Marin County’s cell sites were out of service.\n\nConsumer advocates are urging the PUC to establish backup power requirements and make the companies provide detailed information about the location of outages.\n\nThe California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said in an Oct. 26 letter to communications companies that their level of engagement was “unacceptable” at a time when redundant infrastructure is necessary.\n\nThe utilities commission is frustrated with both communications and utilities companies, saying they failed to share detailed information in real time.\n\nBusinesses and residents also have complained of poor communications and say that the outages were overly broad and carried out thoughtlessly.\n\nJANIE HAR\n\nNews\nJason Gough's forecast: A bit of a break, but for how long?\nA.M.

Credit: SpaceX\n\nWASHINGTON — NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a contract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the moon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\n\nNASA said the five companies — Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems — had been selected to join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for the delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\n\nThis “on-ramp” to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the capability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a rover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south pole of the moon.\n\n“We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need to accelerate that,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a teleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver tools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to delivering science payloads.\n\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its Starship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to 100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified amount back to Earth.\n\n“We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS program,” said Shotwell, referring to NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services effort that funded the development of SpaceX’s commercial cargo capability.\n\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such missions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a “nice stepping stone” to later crewed missions. She didn’t give a date for crewed missions, but said SpaceX would fly Starship “a lot” before flying any missions with people on board.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for its small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\n\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in May, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. “It has a lot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large, open payload deck,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced development programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the lander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the specifics of each individual CLPS task order.\n\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. “Our company is in a great position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because we build our own satellite systems,” said John Roth, vice president of business development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads leveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not disclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to start lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\n\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company’s CLPS award was a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA’s broader plans. “Space exploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire ecosystem of companies,” he said. “Small player being an agility and a creativity that adds to the mix.” He said his company’s lander should be available for missions starting in 2023.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer. Marco Villa, the company’s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage that experience in its lunar landers. “We’re going to start with something smaller,” he said. “Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead us to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.” He declined to say when his company’s lander would be ready.\n\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-ramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year ago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive Machines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond. In May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and OrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order two months later, citing internal business issues.\n\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be released “sometime soon” for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for the VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for science instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two “deliveries” of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n\nCommercial Blue Origin Ceres Robotics CLPS lunar lander Sierra Nevada Corp.

Photograph: Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nInstagram began testing hiding public like counts globally on Thursday, after experimenting with the design tweak in several individual markets abroad. People who upload photos and videos will still know how many people liked them—that information just won’t be seen by other users. The experiment is part of a wider shift at social media companies, so far mostly a rhetorical one, away from the metrics it once told people had immense value. Like Instagram head Adam Mosseri, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has spoken out about the toxic consequences of overemphasizing statistics like follower and like counts. Twitter also released a beta version of its app earlier this year that puts less prominence on likes and retweets.\n\nBut Instagram is one of the only major platforms to try bringing so-called demetrication to a wider segment of users. It’s previously tested removing likes in Italy, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Amid growing criticism of online platforms, abandoning likes allowed Mosseri to claim that Instagram wants to be “a space that feels much less pressurized.” But the Facebook-owned company has also quietly encouraged some users to embrace the anxiety and power that enhanced metrics can provide, by prompting them to convert their personal profiles into Instagram business accounts. Unsurprisingly, opening a business account is also a gateway to buying ads.\n\nInstagram first introduced business accounts in 2016. There are now 140 million monthly active “businesses” across Facebook’s various platforms, according to the company. Any user can convert their personal profile into a “business” or “ creator ” one at any time, both of which come with souped-up analytics capabilities. Many normal people, with no intention of making money from their Instagram presence, have opted-in to the feature. In the age of influencers, where the line between personal branding and personal life has all but disappeared, some people are naturally eager to run their Instagram profile like it’s a job—and Instagram is happy to help.\n\nKym Lino, a spokesperson for Instagram, confirmed to WIRED that the company notifies people who it thinks could benefit from converting their personal accounts into business ones. “We use a machine learning model which predicts likely commercial intent of Instagram accounts to identify potential accounts that may benefit from professional tools like analytics,” they said in an email. It’s unclear what those signals might be, and Instagram declined to say.\n\nI changed my personal Instagram profile, which I started in 2013, into a professional one several weeks ago. Instagram allows you to choose what type of business you run, and I earnestly chose “Journalist.” I later found that many people, especially teens, opt for more ironic options like Cruise Line or Well Water Drilling Service. One friend has labeled herself a Grocery Store. After a few days, the statistics started rolling in. I could suddenly see things like how many people unfollowed me each week, how many visited my profile, and how many tapped on the people and places I tagged in my stories. It was eye-opening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI learned that over a dozen people tapped on the profile of a coworker after I tagged us eating Mexican food in my story. And I found out 46 people, for some reason or another, visited my profile in the last week—but only 16 had come from the one picture I uploaded. On that photo, of one of my oldest friends, I had written a long and gushing caption celebrating her birthday. My business account informed me that someone sent it to another person via direct message, but I couldn’t tell who or why. The analytics made salient the ways my friends and acquaintances surveil one another on Instagram all the time.\n\n“I was stunned just to see how many people visited my profile even without posting for several months,” said Joseph Minga, a friend who recently switched to a professional Instagram account. He learned around 75 to 100 people view his profile a week, out of around 1,500 followers. “It really made me take a step back and ask what are they looking for on here? and in all seriousness, could I have a cyberstalker? ”\n\nInstagram also lets you see how people interact with your stories, including how many view them more than once, and the number who swipe away. “I was on vacation with my parents in France and posted it on my story. And like, of my 1,000 followers, five swiped away,” said Will Tjernlund, a consultant for Amazon sellers who has a business Instagram account. “It’s like wholesome content, that’s normal, and a cool image and background, and someone following me was like nah, not for me dog.”\n\nEven though Instagram’s professional analytics are extremely granular, they’re still anonymized, and can’t account for the reason why someone took a specific action. That makes it easy to agonize about what you don't know. “Since I have seen some of the extra data, I will question why I lost 14 followers in a week where I did not post anything at all. I don’t post as often anymore,” said Minga. “I think I have some sort of social media stage fright. Seeing that people were forwarding my posts to others via DM made me feel insecure.”\n\nIs there something you think we should know about Instagram? Email the writer at louise_matsakis@wired.com. Signal: 347-966-3806. WIRED protects the confidentiality of its sources, but if you wish to conceal your identity, here are the instructions for using SecureDrop. You can also mail us materials at 520 Third Street, Suite 350, San Francisco, CA 94107.\n\nIn addition to behavior metrics, Instagram provides business accounts with a wealth of demographic data about their followers. That includes where they live, how old they are, whether they’re male of female (there’s no recognition of users who identify as nonbinary or transgender) and the times of day they’re active on the platform. It’s easy to see how this information would be useful to an influencer trying to boost engagement, or a brand who wants to know more about their audience. Instagram also attaches a large “Promote” button to every post, giving people the option to turn them into ads.\n\nAs both NBC News and Bloomberg have reported, there’s a security risk associated with business Instagram accounts, which is particularly hazardous for minors. When people convert to business accounts, they often accidentally make their email address or phone number public. The feature is meant to make it easy for people to contact legitimate business entities, but kids with business accounts also end up revealing their personal information to the world.\n\nWIRED spoke to one mother, who knew her teenage daughter and son were masquerading as a Tax Preparation Service and a Go-Kart Track on Instagram, but didn’t realize their personal information might be on their profiles. “I am so ahead of every other parent of teens I know when it comes to technology,” she said. “I am literally facepalming that my 14-year-old son has a public Instagram account with his phone number on it.” Her daughter, on the other hand, had cleverly put down the number for Pizza Hut instead.\n\n“Businesses and creators are clearly informed in the sign-up or conversion flow that the contact information they would like to make public to help people contact them will be displayed,” Lino said. Last month, Instagram also made it possible for creator and business accounts to choose not to display their contact information.\n\nDavid Stier, a data scientist and business advisor in the Bay Area, has spent the last few months trying to track the global number of minors who may have professional Instagram accounts. He stumbled upon the issue while researching Instagram marketing for a potential client and became concerned. Because users can easily toggle between being corporations, “creators,” and normal people, Stier says he noticed the lines between all three groups on Instagram have blurred. “This thing is broken, like completely broken, in terms of a way of classifying and identifying what kind of an entity you are,” he says.\n\nMaybe Instagram likes it that way. After all, the platform has helped thousands of people monetize otherwise personal content about their lives. The boundaries between a money-making entity and a personal scrapbook are gone. Microinfluencers, and even nanoinfluencers (people with only a few thousand followers on Instagram at most), are now paid to hawk products like makeup and shampoo. Are these accounts actual businesses, in the traditional sense? Maybe not, but they often have access to the same analytics as one.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\nThe strange life and mysterious death of a virtuoso coder\nHow Facebook gets the First Amendment backward\nThe enduring power of Asperger's, even as a non-diagnosis\nHow to opt out of the sites that sell your personal data\nWhat Google's Fitbit buy means for the future of wearables\n👁 A safer way to protect your data; plus, check out the latest news on AI\n🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?

More than 100 protesters killed in Iran unrest\n\nNovember 20, 2019 - 11:28 AMT\n\nPanARMENIAN.Net - Verified video footage, eyewitness testimony from people on the ground and information gathered from human rights activists outside Iran reveal a harrowing pattern of unlawful killings by Iranian security forces, which have used excessive and lethal force to crush largely peaceful protests in more than 100 cities across Iran sparked by a hike in fuel prices on 15 November, said Amnesty International on Tuesday, November 19.\n\nAt least 106 protesters in 21 cities have been killed, according to credible reports received by Amnesty. The organization believes that the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed. State media have reported only a handful of protester deaths, as well as the deaths of at least four members of the security forces.\n\nVideo footage shows security forces using firearms, water cannons and tear gas to disperse protests and beating demonstrators with batons. Images of bullet casings left on the ground afterwards, as well as the resulting high death toll, indicate that they used live ammunition.\n\n“The authorities must end this brutal and deadly crackdown immediately and show respect for human life,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.\n\n“The frequency and persistence of lethal force used against peaceful protesters in these and previous mass protests, as well as the systematic impunity for security forces who kill protesters, raise serious fears that the intentional lethal use of firearms to crush protests has become a matter of state policy.”\n\nHundreds of demonstrators blocked roads, using their parked cars as a form of protest. Verified video footage shows riot police smashing windows of cars with drivers still inside.\n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts corroborated by video footage, snipers have also shot into crowds of people from rooftops and, in one case, a helicopter.\n\nRelated links:\nRTVI: Amnesty International: в Иране больше ста человек погибли в ходе протестов из-за повышения цен на бензин\nAmnesty International.

He urged Vietnam and others in the region to push back.\n\n“We will not accept attempts to assert unlawful maritime claims at the expense of law-abiding nations,” Esper said in a speech to the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, a government university.\n\nVietnam is one of the region’s most vocal critics of China’s sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea and has accused Beijing of encroaching into its waters.\n\n“The United States firmly opposes intimidation by any claimant to assert its territorial or maritime claims, and we call for an end to the bullying and unlawful activities,” Esper said.\n\nLater, in remarks at Vietnam’s Communist Party headquarters, Esper said, “We strongly oppose violations of international law by China and excessive claims in the South China Sea.”\n\nAs part of a long-term effort to forge closer relations with Vietnam, Esper announced that the U.S. will provide Vietnam’s coast guard with a surplus American ship. He said it would be provided next year, but he gave no details on payment or exact timing.\n\nEsper met with several top government officials and paid a visit to the city’s Hoa Lo prison, dubbed the “Hanoi Hilton” by American servicemen held there during the Vietnam War. The late Sen. John McCain was held there after he was shot down in his Navy jet over Hanoi in 1967.\n\nTrending Now\n\nJ.J.

He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\n\nThe case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London.\n\nHowever, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and promptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status. That came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid extradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\n\nFollowing Assange’s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the case asked for the investigation to be resumed.\nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\nAssange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail.\n\nThe US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\n\nThe US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.\n\nVia SyndiGate.info\n\nCopyright © 2019 Press TV.

        "articleBody": "Our BI Research Shows - A Mix of Native Ad Units Generate the Highest Engagement Metrics for Marketers and the Greatest Revenue for Publishers | my6sense\n\nPlatform\nFeatures\nAd Networks\nGroup Publishers\nDSPs\nBlog\nAbout\nContact Us\nMenu\n\nOur BI Research Shows – A Mix of Native Ad Units Generate the Highest Engagement Metrics for Marketers and the Greatest Revenue for Publishers\n\nFebruary 15, 2018\n\nThough recommendation widgets are the most popular type of native ad units and generate the greatest revenue, optimal native ad performance on both the demand and supply side is achieved by running the range of native ad units.\n\nNew York, NY – The range of native ad units now available have powered native ad spending past all other forms of display advertising in 2017, according to analysis from Poynter.\n\nBut are all native ads equal for marketers and publishers?\n\nTo answer this question and gain a greater understanding of the range of native ad units, the my6sense data analytics team analyzed billions of recommendation widget, in-feed and in-ad native ad units served via my6sense’s white label programmatic native ad platform in the last 6 months of 2017.\n\nOn the supply side, recommendation widgets are the most profitable among the native ad units, followed closely by in-feed ad units, which are 20% less profitable than recommendation widgets. Recommendation widgets provide publishers with an\n\neffective way to recirculate organic content which increases publisher engagement metrics including time spent and pages viewed while also generating revenue from the additional ads viewed. In-feed ads earn the highest revenue per ad but generate a lower RPM (Revenue Per Thousand) for publishers since recommendation widgets include multiple ads in the same ad unit.\n\nIn-feed units provide the supply side with a new revenue stream when they appear within content lists and articles. Among the three primary native ad units, in-ad units generate about one quarter of the revenue of recommendation widgets, yet are quick and easy to implement at scale on standard banner placements with no required layout changes, while they outperform traditional banner ads from both revenue and user experience perspectives.\n\nOn the demand side, in-feed ads generate the highest CTR and user engagement, 2.5 times greater than ads in recommendation widgets and about 10 times higher than ads within in-ad units. The ratio was similar when comparing effective CPMs for paid ad items across these three types of native ad units.\n\nThe strong performance of in-feed ads for brand campaigns is the result of the exclusive presence they receive as the only ad in view with larger images and longer texts, resulting in higher engagement rates. While in-feed ads dominate for branding campaigns, recommendation widgets and in-ad units, which are more cost-effective, perform better for direct response campaigns.\n\nThough each of the three native ad units is unique, the best performing native ad campaigns for advertisers are those running with optimized A/B creatives in recommendation widgets, in-feed and in-ad units combined. And on the supply side, the combination of all three ad units results in the greatest revenue rates for publishers.\n\n“In the same way Olympic champions utilize a broad range of training activities to achieve peak performance, my6sense marketers achieving the highest engagement rates and publishers generate the greatest revenue by running all three native ad units in parallel – recommendation widgets, in-feed and in-ad,” said Avinoam Rubinstain, CEO & founder, my6sense.\n\nWhich native ad units are the most popular?\n\nRecommendation widgets are the most popular form of native ad units (38%), followed by in-feed units (30%), in-ad units (25%) and finally textual and custom designs (7%).\n\nDespite the smaller screen size, native ads on mobile devices generate twice the CTR of native ads on desktops, though the effective CPM is 30% lower on mobile because advertisers still pay more for desktop ads.\n\nmy6sense provides the only fully programmatic native exchange solution for multi-item native ad units combined with comprehensive organic content recirculation, enabling clients and partners to easily mix recommendation widgets, in-feed, in-ad units and any other custom native ad units with any number of ad items on the page.\n\nAbout my6sense\n\nmy6sense offers an open programmatic white label native advertising platform for ad networks, media trading companies, group publishers, DSPs and SSPs.

Prior to launch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7 teraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high settings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\n\nAccording to The Verge’s Stadia review, the streaming platform does not run its showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K. Google confirmed this in a statement…\n\nGoogle Stadia Pricing for Games Available Now – Pro Subscribers Get Discounts\n\nWhen streaming at 4K, we render at a native 1080p and then upsample and apply a variety of techniques to increase the overall quality of effect.\n\nNot only is Destiny 2 not true 4K on Stadia, it runs at medium settings. So, in other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X version, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny 2 isn’t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised – it's revealed in Eurogamer’s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders at 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the Xbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line experience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-than-ideal visual performance.\n\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn’t terrible. If you’re not a particularly techy person and just looking at Stadia as a replacement for consoles, it’s not a bad alternative. That said, Google promised more, and for whatever reason, they’re not delivering yet. Hopefully they can work the kinks out and offer a true high-end experience soon.\n\nThe Google Stadia Founder’s and Premiere Editions, which come with a Chromecast Ultra, launch tomorrow (November 19) in 14 countries, including United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. More traditional free-to-play and premium subscription options arrive in early 2020.\n\nShare Tweet Submit\n\nRelated\n\nGRID’s Stadia Exclusive Mode is All About Endurance Racing\n\nAlessio Palumbo • Nov 18\n10\n\nStadia Launches Tomorrow as Google Officially Enters the Video Game Market\n\nRohail Saleem • Nov 18\n11\n\nBorderlands 3 Producer Was Actually Shocked at How Smooth The Game Plays on Stadia\n\nAlessio Palumbo • Nov 18\n13\n\nStadia Launch Line-up Almost Doubled – Extra Game for Pro Subscribers\n\nChris Wray • Nov 18\n10\n\nUK Labour Party Proposes Big-Tech Tax to Pay for Nationalisation of Broadband, Free Fibre for All\n\nChris Wray • Nov 15\n16\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\nPC Builder\n\nPurpose\n\nGaming Workstation\n\nBudget\n\n$1000\n\nTrending Stories\n\nAMD Radeon Pro W5700 With Navi 10 GPU Announced For Workstations – USB Type-C & 9 TFLOPs For $799 US\nNVIDIA Super Graphics Cards Coming To Notebooks In March 2020\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti SUPER Ultimate Flagship Graphics Card Rumored To Feature 4608 Cores & 16 Gbps GDDR6 Memory\nPS5 – Every Official News, Leak & Rumor on Sony’s Next-Gen Console\nBiostar Exec Says AMD B550 and Intel 400-Series Motherboards Are Ready For Release\n\nPopular Discussions\n\nIntel Xe GPU Architecture Detailed – Ponte Vecchio Xe HPC Exascale GPU With 1000s of EUs, Massive HBM Memory, Rambo Cache 2466\nAMD Ryzen 7 2700X 8 Core CPU Available At An Insanely Good Price of $130 US, Get A AAA Game and Xbox Game Pass As Well 2245\nRyzen DRAM Calculator Tool Author Not Receiving Ryzen 9 3950X or sTRX Samples 2083\nMSI Announces Radeon RX 580 Armor Series Graphics Cards 1919\nAMD Radeon Pro W5700 With Navi 10 GPU Announced For Workstations – USB Type-C & 9 TFLOPs For $799 US 1746\n\nSubscribe\n\nWccftech TV\n\n01:45\n\nFinally, A New Half Life Game Is Coming Out?!\n\n09:09\n\nNeed for Speed: Heat Gameplay [PS4]\n\n01:52\n\nAMD To Introduce RDNA2 Based Navi GPU at CES With Ray Tracing & More\n\n11:57\n\nTerminator: Resistance Gameplay [PS4]\n\n01:27\n\nProject Scarlett Won’t Be Out of Position on Power or Price According to Phil Spencer\n\n01:53\n\nNeon Noir - Real Time Ray Tracing On Radeon RX 5700XT\n\n01:34\n\nAnalyst Indicates NVIDIA Introducing Ampere in March 2020\n\n01:41\n\nKojima Believes Death Stranding Had Stronger Criticism in the US, Possibly Because It Flies Above Sh\n\n01:37\n\nNewest Gigabyte TRX40 Motherboards Are Going To Be Pricey!\n\n01:36\n\nAMD Radeon RX 5500 ‘Navi 14’ Graphics Card Aimed at Performance Segment\n\n01:54\n\nAMD’s Ryzen 9 3950X 16 Core CPU Faster Than Intel’s Flagship Core i9 10980XE In Geekbench\n\n01:51\n\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X & 3960X Retailer Prices Confirmed\n\n01:45\n\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32 Core & 64 Thread CPU Listed Online\n\n05:01\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 PC Benchmark Run Test [4K@60FPS, Ultra Settings]]\n\n01:41\n\nAMD’s Next Gen Ryzen Threadripper CPUs Announcement Planned For November 7th\n\nSections\n\nReviews\nHow To's\nExclusives\nInterviews\nDeals\nVideo\nEntertainment\nPC Builder\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\nKnow Us\n\nAbout\nAdvertise\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookie Policy\nChange Ad Consent\n\nFollow US\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\n\nSubscribe\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to our daily newsletter\n\nWccftech © 2019 NewAge ADS, LLC.

Credit: 20th Century Fox\n\nIf a sci-fi spaceship does not come with hyperdrive then it is usually fitted with hibernation capsules instead. In movies from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Event Horizon, Alien to Passengers, fictional astronauts get put into \"suspended animation\" to cross the vastness of space. Now ESA has investigated how real life crew hibernation would impact space mission design.\n\nHuman hibernation has been the subject of initial research within the Discovery element of ESA's Basic Activities, then recommended as a key \"enabling technology\" for space by the Agency's Future Technology Advisory Panel, resulting in a dedicated \"Topical Team\" on hibernation.\n\nNow the Agency's SciSpacE team has called in ESA's Concurrent Design Facility—a multimedia facility enabling expert teams to perform initial evaluations of proposed future missions—to assess the advantages of human hibernation for a trip to a neighboring planet, such as Mars.\n\nBeginning with an assessment on the current state of the art in human hibernation, with the help of ESA Topical Team scientists from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Goethe, Frankfurt, the CDF team went to investigate for the first time the potential impact of hibernation on system-level mission design. They took as their reference an existing mission study to send six humans to Mars and back in a five year timescale.\n\n\"We worked on adjusting the architecture of the spacecraft, its logistics, protection against radiation, power consumption and overall mission design,\" comments Robin Biesbroek of the CDF.\n\nA reference habitation module for a crewed Mars mission compared to its hibernation-based equivalent. Credit: ESA\n\n\"We looked at how an astronaut team could be best put into hibernation, what to do in case of emergencies, how to handle human safety and even what impact hibernation would have on the psychology of the team. Finally we created an initial sketch of the habitat architecture and created a roadmap to achieve a validated approach to hibernate humans to Mars within 20 years.\"\n\nThe study found the spacecraft mass could be reduced by a third by removing the crew quarters with a similar reduction in consumables, equivalent to several tons of saved mass. Hibernation would take place in small individual pods that would double as cabins while the crew are awake.\n\nThe assumption was that a drug would be administered to induce \"torpor\"—the term for the hibernating state. Like hibernating animals, the astronauts would be expected to acquire extra body fat in advance of torpor. Their soft-shell pods would be darkened and their temperature greatly reduced to cool their occupants during their projected 180-day Earth-Mars cruise.\n\nThe hibernating cruise phase would end with a 21 day recuperation period—although based on the experience of animal hibernation, the expectation would be that the crew would not experience bone or muscle wastage.\n\nFunctional areas of the hibernation module: (1) private crew quarters, (2) exercise, (3) hygiene and waste, (4) dining and wardroom, (5) workstation, (6) galley and food, (7) medical supplies, (8) life support systems and stowage, (9) operational and maintenance supplies. In general, the habitat is divided into two zones of habitable volumes: the crew quarters which are used during the entire mission duration, and the volumes for wardroom and workstation, food preparation and eating, waste collection and hygiene, exercise, medical, operational and maintenance purposes that are only used during the time the crew is awake and active. Credit: ESA\n\nA cross-section through the hibernation module showing the individual quarters that would double as hibernation pods during the cruise phase. The soft-shelled pods would have individual thermal controls and flexible insulation, with a fan to circulate air and control humidity to prevent condensation when the temperature is reduced during hibernation. The pods would also be well shielded against radiation. (1) private crew quarters, (8) life support system and stowage, (10) circulation space. Credit: ESA\n\nRadiation exposure from high-energy particles is a key hazard of deep space travel, but because the hibernating crew will be spending so much time in their hibernation pods, then shielding—such as water containers—could be concentrated around them. And existing research into hibernation shows it gives enhanced radiation protection in its own right.\n\nBut with all the crew incapacitated for extended periods of time, the mission would have to be designed for largely autonomous operations, with optimum use of artificial intelligence and \"fault detection, isolation and recovery\" to maintain a minimum level of system performance until the crew could be revived.\n\n\"For a while now hibernation has been proposed as a game-changing tool for human space travel,\" explains SciSpacE Team Leader Jennifer Ngo-Anh. \"If we were able to reduce an astronaut's basic metabolic rate by 75% – similar to what we can observe in nature with large hibernating animals such as certain bears—we could end up with substantial mass and cost savings, making long-duration exploration missions more feasible.\n\n\"And the basic idea of putting astronauts into long-duration hibernation is actually not so crazy: a broadly comparable method has been tested and applied as therapy in critical care trauma patients and those due to undergo major surgeries for more than two decades. Most major medical centers have protocols for inducing hypothermia in patients to reduce their metabolism to basically gain time, keeping patients in a better shape than they otherwise would be.\n\n\"We aim to build on this in future, by researching the brain pathways that are activated or blocked during initiation of hibernation, starting with animals and proceeding to people.\"\n\nExplore further\n\nUnravelling the neural network of torpor\nMore information: G.

And that means a slaughter of some degree.\n\nXi's problem is simple. Hong Kong police and their Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence service masters are proving unable to stem the mass disorder. In so, painting a picture of political incompetence and security impotence, Hong Kong's street battles are an existential threat to Xi's regime. The protests degrade the Chinese Communist Party's claim to a divine right of power and weaken Xi's global narrative of a China that is destined to lead.\n\nTo be sure, Xi and his comrades on the powerful Standing Committee do not want to send the army into Hong Kong.\n\nThey know that doing so would spark immediate international furor and pressure otherwise China-sympathetic Western interests such as President Emmanuel Macron and the NBA to degrade their relationships with Beijing. Yet, neither can Xi allow this chaos to continue. Every day it does, the Communist Party appears weaker and thus more vulnerable to that which it most fears: resistance to its rule on the mainland and new international resistance to its global agenda.\n\nAnd Beijing's current strategy for ending the protests is an obvious and manifest failure. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's recent trip to Beijing — a trip likely designed to avoid Western intelligence monitoring of communications — was about Beijing offering new guidance to end the violence. But Beijing's diktats to Lam have achieved nothing but chaos, agitating the protesters into new resistance.\n\nNor has Beijing's backtracking on the extradition law, which sparked the protests cooled protester fury. Propaganda efforts to persuade protesters to fall in love with the Communist Party have been similarly catastrophic. A recent face mask ban has also served the opposite effect and was ruled illegal by the Hong Kong court system on Monday. That decision by a relatively independent judiciary emphasizes the stakes in this great struggle between authoritarian aggression and the democratic rule of law.\n\nAt the same time, however, those who believe Xi's Communist Party is stuck are deluding themselves.\n\nUnlike us in the West, the Standing Committee views its mission to usurp the American-led liberal international order through the prism of generations, not years. Nor does Xi see Hong Kong struggle through a simple microcosm of individual rights versus central power. He sees it as a great test for his Chinese dream. Forced to choose between a military crackdown, which sparks a year or two of international fury, and Hong Kong's collapse into anarchy, Xi will choose the former.\n\nIn short, slaughter is likely coming to Hong Kong.\n\nOpinion\nBeltway Confidential\nChina\nXi Jinping\nHong Kong\nProtests\nBeijing\n\nShare your thoughts with friends.\n\nMore Washington Examiner\n\nCarlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\nAnthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\nWednesday November 20, 2019\nOur family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week.

Report claiming US has the ‘world's highest rate of children in detention’ is bogus\n\nBecket Adams\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nVarious outlets, including Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press, National Public Radio, and Reuters, reported that a United Nations study showed that there are more “than 100,000 children in migration-related U.S. detention.” That sounds pretty bad. It means America “has the world’s highest rate of children in detention.”\n\nMarie Yovanovitch is the only impeachment witness so far to demonstrate a legitimate gripe\n\nEddie Scarry\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nAfter three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so far with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of the impeachment pursuit of President Trump.\n\nMedia and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials\n\nBecket Adams\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nIt is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and personal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including Ambassador William Taylor, Lt.

Here is what we learned:\n\nImpeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\nTom Rogan\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nBeyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-Ukraine relationship remains strong.

Instead, the Democrats attempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the pivot bombed fantastically.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\nKaylee McGhee\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nLt.

Unsurprisingly, members of the militant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, continue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the announcement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold Christian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\" will not be satisfied.\n\nKemp Foundation embraces free enterprise's creative disruption\n\nQuin Hillyer\nTuesday November 19, 2019\nJimmy Kemp sounds a whole lot like his eloquent father, the late Republican official and idea man Jack Kemp, and this is a very good thing.

A female wax technician should never be forced by the state to wax a transgender woman’s testicles. Nor should a Christian baker be forced to endorse messages he doesn’t believe in. All have the First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech, and that right doesn't disappear when we begin to engage in business.\n\nAbout Examiner\nMagazine Archive\nStaff\nAdvertise\nContact\nSubscribe\nEvents\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTerms Of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCopyright 2019.

        "articleBody": "15 Helpful Tips to Overcome Binge Eating\n\nSubscribe\n\nNutrition\n\nEvidence Based\n\n15 Helpful Tips to Overcome Binge Eating\n\nWritten by Rachael Link, MS, RD on November 14, 2019\n\nBinge eating disorder (BED) is considered the most common feeding and eating disorder in the United States (1).\n\nBED is about more than food, it’s a recognized psychological condition. That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it.\n\nPeople who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when they’re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame.\n\nRegular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try — both at home and with the help of a professional — to reduce episodes of binge eating.\n\nHere are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\n\n1. Ditch the diet\n\nFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\n\nFor example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).\n\nSimilarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).\n\nInstead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes.\n\nEat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health.\n\nSummary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely.\n\n2. Avoid skipping meals\n\nSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating.\n\nSkipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\n\nOne small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day (4).\n\nAnother study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nTry setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\n\nSummary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar.\n\n3. Practice mindfulness\n\nMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment.\n\nThis technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry.\n\nOne review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).\n\nAnother small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).\n\nTry listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\n\nSummary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you’re no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating.\n\n4. Stay hydrated\n\nDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating.\n\nIn fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake.\n\nFor example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group (8).\n\nSimilarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13–17 ounces (375–500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).\n\nOther studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and weight loss (10, 11).\n\nThe amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors. Thus, it’s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to ensure you’re staying well hydrated.\n\nSummary Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease calorie intake and prevent binge eating.\n\n5. Try yoga\n\nYoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific breathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance relaxation.\n\nStudies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of emotional eating.\n\nOne small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks led to a significant reduction in binging (12).\n\nAnother study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating disorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances — all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).\n\nResearch also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).\n\nTry joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your routine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.\n\nSummary Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety.\n\n6. Eat more fiber\n\nFiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full longer (16).\n\nSome research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce appetite, and food intake.\n\nOne small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of fiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing fullness (17).\n\nAnother study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber daily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and significantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).\n\nFruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods that can keep you feeling full.\n\nSummary Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake and feelings of hunger.\n\n7. Clean out the kitchen\n\nHaving lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much easier to binge eat.\n\nConversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional eating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.\n\nStart by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-packaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.\n\nStocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge eating unhealthy foods.\n\nSummary Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge eat.\n\n8. Start hitting the gym\n\nStudies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge eating.\n\nFor instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly exercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).\n\nAnother study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with regular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of binge eating than therapy alone (20).\n\nPlus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and enhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).\n\nWalking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few different forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce binge eating.\n\nSummary Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge eating and decrease stress levels.\n\n9. Eat breakfast every day\n\nStarting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge eating later in the day.\n\nSeveral studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is associated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).\n\nPlus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings and reduce hunger throughout the day.\n\nFor example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast reduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb breakfast (22).\n\nMeanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve appetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).\n\nTry combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.\n\nSummary Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings and keep you satisfied throughout the morning.\n\n10. Get enough sleep\n\nSleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be linked to binge eating.\n\nIn fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported significantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this condition (24).\n\nAnother large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin — the hormone responsible for promoting fullness.\n\nAdditionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body weight (25).\n\nAim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check and reduce your risk of binge eating.\n\nSummary BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect hunger and appetite.\n\n11. Keep a food and mood journal\n\nKeeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can be an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food triggers and promote healthier eating habits.\n\nOne study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that involved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes of binge eating (26).\n\nSeveral other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to increased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).\n\nTo get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day using either a journal or app.\n\nSummary Food and mood journals can help identify triggers to address potential problems. Studies show that using a food diary is associated with fewer episodes of binge eating, as well as increased weight loss.\n\n12. Find someone to talk to\n\nTalking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your likelihood of overeating.\n\nOne study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that reliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).\n\nAnother study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was linked to decreased binge eating severity (31).\n\nA good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which may help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32, 33).\n\nNext time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted friend or family member. If you don’t have someone to talk to, eating disorder helplines are available free of charge.\n\nSummary A good social support system may be linked to decreased binge eating and stress.\n\n13. Increase your protein intake\n\nUpping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help control your appetite.\n\nOne study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% led to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as decreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).\n\nSimilarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced metabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite (35).\n\nTry including at least one good source of protein — such as meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, or legumes — in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel hungry to keep cravings at bay.\n\nSummary Increasing your protein intake has been shown to decrease calorie intake, enhance feelings of fullness, and increase levels of GLP-1, a hormone that can help suppress appetite.\n\n14. Plan meals\n\nPlanning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to prepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the remainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge.\n\nIn fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was associated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower risk of obesity (36).\n\nMeal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which has been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nSet aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your meals.\n\nSummary Meal planning has been associated with improvements in diet quality and variety. It can also make sticking to a regular eating pattern easier and ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand at all times.\n\n15. Seek help\n\nWhile the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan designed by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.\n\nTreatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to help get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then develops strategies to modify your behavior (37).\n\nOther types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss therapy (37).\n\nAntidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also sometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of these medications (38, 39).\n\nSummary Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered an effective treatment method for binge eating. Other types of therapy and certain medications can also be used.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBED is a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people around the world.\n\nHowever, it’s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and healthy lifestyle modifications.\n\nWritten by Rachael Link, MS, RD on November 14, 2019\n\nrelated stories\n\nBinge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\nBinge Eating Disorder History: A Timeline\nWhat’s the Difference Between Overeating and Binge Eating Disorder?\nBinge Eating Disorder: Understanding Your Triggers\nCan Antidepressants Treat Binge Eating Disorder?\n\nRead this next\n\nBinge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\nWritten by Elise Mandl, BSc, APD\n\nBinge eating disorder (BED) is the most common type of eating disorder.

        "articleBody": "UK Tories under fire for Twitter name switch during debate | Hosted\n\nSkip to main content\n\nMenu\n\nNational News\n\nNational Sports\n\nLocal News\nLocal Sports\nObits\nE-Edition\n\nNov. 20, 2019 6:02 AM EST\n\nUK Tories under fire for Twitter name switch during debate\n\nBy DANICA KIRKA and JILL LAWLESS\nAssociated Press\nBC-EU--Britain-Brexit-Election, 1st Ld-Writethru\nITV, ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nLONDON (AP) — Britain's Conservative Party was accused Wednesday of trying to deceive voters by changing the name of its press office Twitter account to “factcheckUK” during a televised election debate between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nView all (4)\n\nRebranded to resemble a neutral fact-checking account, it posted a series of tweets supporting Johnson during Tuesday’s debate. It later reverted to the name “CCHQ Press” and restored the party logo to its profile.\n\nOrganizations that seek to combat political misinformation cried foul.\n\n“It was an attempt to mislead voters,’’ Will Moy, chief executive of the London-based fact-checking website Full Fact, told the BBC. “And I think it is inappropriate and misleading for a serious political party to behave that way.”\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the party’s actions, saying the Twitter account was clearly linked to the Conservatives.\n\n“We make no apology for having an instant rebuttal to all the nonsense and lies put out,” Raab told the BBC.\n\nTwitter pledged to take “decisive corrective action” against similar strategies in the future. But the manipulation of the account in a high-profile event put the issue of the rise of digital campaigning squarely in the public eye.\n\nAll political parties are devoting much of their campaign spending to the digital realm as they battle to win the U.K.’s Dec. 12 election.\n\nDespite parliamentary reports urging new regulations to combat misinformation or regulate the way digital ads are targeted at voters, officials in Britain have made no significant changes to laws governing online ads, social media and election disinformation.\n\nIn a reflection of the confusion, the Electoral Commission, which regulates campaign finances, issued a statement warning that “voters are entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners in the lead-up to an election.’’ Critically, however, it pointed out that it doesn’t have “a role in regulating election campaign content.’’\n\nWith the absence of law, campaigns have already been pressing the boundaries to get attention. The Conservative Party became embroiled in controversy earlier this month when it posted a video on social media containing a misleading edit of a television interview with Keir Starmer, a senior Labour Party figure. The video had been altered to show Starmer failing to answer a question about Brexit, when, in fact, he responded quickly. The chairman of the Conservative Party described the doctored video as lighthearted satire.\n\nIn their first TV debate of the election on Tuesday, Johnson and Corbyn attacked each other’s policies on Brexit, health care and the economy.\n\nBut the debate likely failed to answer the question that has dogged the campaign: Who can voters trust? The two leaders sidestepped tricky questions about their own policies in the hourlong encounter and drew derisive laughter from the studio audience at several points.\n\nBoth Johnson and Corbyn are trying to overcome a mountain of mistrust as they try to win over a Brexit-weary electorate.\n\nJohnson is under fire for failing to deliver on his often-repeated vow that Britain would leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\nAudience members laughed when he urged voters, “Look what I have said I’m going to do as a politician and look what I’ve delivered.”\n\nCorbyn, a stolid socialist, is accused by critics of promoting high-tax policies and of failing to clamp down on anti-Semitism within his party. His refusal to say which side he would be on in a Brexit referendum was also met with hoots of laughter.\n\nTelevised debates are a relatively new phenomenon in British elections — the first took place in 2010 — and they have the power to transform campaigns. A confident 2010 appearance by former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg sparked a wave of “Cleggmania” that helped to propel him into the deputy prime minister post in a coalition government with the Conservatives. Clegg now works for Facebook.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nTopics\n\nBusiness\n,\nGeneral news\n,\nGovernment and politics\n,\nOnline media\n,\nPolitical debates\n,\nCampaigns\n,\nSocial media\n,\nBrexit referendum\n\nPlaces in this Story\n\nUnited Kingdom\nLondon\n\nOrganizations in this Story\n\nUnited Kingdom government\n\nPeople in the Story\n\nJeremy Corbyn\nNick Clegg\nBoris Johnson\n\nTrending\n\n'Tarzan' actor Ron Ely's wife killed; son shot by deputies\nIowa man finds 5 inches of animal blood flooding basement\nAirline went into records after Max crash, engineer says\n\nWilkes-Barre News\n\nDallas’ Balara has come a long way since freshman year\nNov. 20, 2019 12:00 AM EST\nFormer president of MotorWorld wins Lifetime Achievement Award\nNov. 20, 2019 12:00 AM EST\nYudichak leaves Democratic Party\nNov. 20, 2019 12:00 AM EST\n\n©2019 The Associated Press.

( STEVE GSCHMEISSNER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY)\n\nBy Brigit Katz\nsmithsonian.com\nNovember 18, 2019\n\nThree cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears about the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak is low.\n\nAs Emily Feng reports for NPR, the first cases came to light last week, when authorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought treatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are from Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the northern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, one of the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis —the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the infection spreads to the lungs. Yersinia pestis, per the WHO, is often found in small mammals and their fleas.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly contagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. Without medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery rates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\nThe ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people who might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the New York Times. All “relevant sites” were also disinfected, reports Wee. The CDC assured the public on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, that the risks of transmission were “extremely low.”\n\nOn November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also from Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the Washington Post, killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that 28 people who came into contact with the patient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague—like the sudden onset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no epidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the Inner Mongolia health commission said, according to Reuters.\n\nOver the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world, most famously during the Black Death, which wiped out nearly one-third of Europe’s population in the 1300s. Yersinia pestis is believed to have originated in China, spreading to the West via ships. Today, plague infections are rare, but they do happen. According to WHO, there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has experienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years—26 cases and 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports Reuters.\n\nThough the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake of the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are minimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\n\nThe first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to NPR ’s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were treated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the facility on November 3—nine days before an announcement was made, raising questions about the reason for the delay.\n\nLi explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified, and announcements about them cannot be “transmitted casually.” But her post was still taken down by censors. Wee of the Times reports that censors had also instructed digital news aggregators to “block and control” discussions pertaining the news about the plague.\n\n“Don't hide things like this,” one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. “Let’s face whatever it is together.”\n\nCurrent fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by China’s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were accused of concealing the true extent of the country’s SARS outbreak—and Beijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times as many cases as they had initially reported.\n\nIn the wake of that outbreak, China “vastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases,” writes the Associated Press. And though the Chinese CDC has said that there is “no need” for Beijing residents to worry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote regions of the country—like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau—are vulnerable to outbreaks.

News.\n\n\"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an insider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have operational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these negotiations.\"\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record label, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29, however the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s calls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT CLEARED TO PERFORM HITS AT AMAs AMID FEUD WITH SCOOTER BRAUN, BIG MACHINE RECORDS: REPORT\n\nScooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on June 28, 2019 in Montecito, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Ithaca Holdings)\n\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider added of the continuing spat.\n\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it possible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards after Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned company of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own the master recordings, at the AMAs\n\nA LONG, DRAWN OUT HISTORY OF TAYLOR SWIFT'S FEUDS\n\nThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and Dick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not only cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\nVideo\n\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\n\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that it had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\nBraun’s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift’s first six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008’s “Fearless” and 2014’s “1989.” (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP)\n\n“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production company said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”\n\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big Machine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has been working on where her music was to be used.\n\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its website.\n\nVideo\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT'S FORMER LABEL BOSS BLASTS HER SCOOTER BRAUN 'BULLYING' CLAIMS, SAYS SHE KNEW ABOUT SALE\n\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read. \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.\n\nVideo\n\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,\" the statement concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\nA rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.\n\nFox News’ Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.\n\nJulius is an LA Entertainment Reporter for Fox News.\n\nOn Our Radar\n\nGronk's SI girlfriend tells all\n\n'Bach' SHOCKING sex confession\n\nArnold's love child recreates iconic pic\n\nElizabeth Hurley doesn't age\n\nSerious allegation against Markle\n\n'Dukes' star: I 'didn't see it coming'\n\nHow Elvis bombed at Opry\n\nTaste of Country\n\nTrending in Entertainment\n\n'Bachelor' alum Amanda Stanton says parenting makes self-care hard\n\nHollywood exec suggested Julia Roberts should play Harriet Tubman\n\nKelly Clarkson laughs off 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' backlash: 'We didn't kill Christmas'\n\nTom Hanks discovers he's related to Fred Rogers: report\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nU.S.\n\nCrime\nMilitary\nEducation\nTerror\nImmigration\nEconomy\nPersonal Freedoms\nFox News Investigates\n\nWorld\n\nU.N.\nConflicts\nTerrorism\nDisasters\nGlobal Economy\nEnvironment\nReligion\nScandals\n\nOpinion\n\nPolitics\n\nExecutive\nSenate\nHouse\nJudiciary\nForeign policy\nPolls\nElections\n\nEntertainment\n\nCelebrity News\nMovies\nTV News\nMusic News\nStyle News\nEntertainment Video\n\nBusiness\n\nMarkets\nPolitics\nTechnology\nFeatures\nBusiness Leaders\n\nLifestyle\n\nFood + Drink\nCars + Trucks\nTravel + Outdoors\nHouse + Home\nFitness + Well-being\nStyle + Beauty\nFamily\n\nScience\n\nArchaeology\nAir & Space\nPlanet Earth\nWild Nature\nNatural Science\nDinosaurs\n\nTech\n\nSecurity\nInnovation\nDrones\nComputers\nVideo Games\nMilitary Tech\n\nHealth\n\nHealthy Living\nMedical Research\nMental Health\nCancer\nHeart Health\nChildren's Health\n\nTV\n\nShows\nPersonalities\nWatch Live\nFull Episodes\nShow Clips\nNews Clips\n\nAbout\n\nContact Us\nCareers\nFox Around the World\nAdvertise With Us\nAd Choices\nMedia Relations\nCompliance\nSupplier Diversity\n\nOther\n\nFox Nation\nFox News Shop\nFox News Go\nFox News Radio\nNewsletters\nAlerts\nPodcasts\nApps & Products\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nGoogle+\nInstagram\nRSS\nEmail\n\nFox News\n\nTerms of Use\nUpdated Privacy Policy (What's Changed)\nClosed Captioning Policy\nHelp\nContact Us\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\n\nI know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set priorities.\n\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\nAnd you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at that.\n\n2. Don’t forget to drink water\n\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\n\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they’re there.\n\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\n\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re feeling especially hungry.\n\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\nThat’s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, we’ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\n\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\n\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n4. “Veggie-fy” your chips ‘n’ dip\n\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie instead.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\n\nAnd don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\nHealthy Game Day Dip:\n\nMix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you’ll get plenty of tangy crunch — without all the calories.\n\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\n\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\n\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories — about the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself “no.” That’s why I always tell my clients: “an open face is a happy face!”\n\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!\n\nGet started with 2B Mindset here.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWeight Loss\n\nWhy Am I Not Losing Weight?\n\nWeight Loss\n\nYou CAN Lose Weight Without “Starving”\n\nWeight Loss\n\nSmart Food Swaps to Outsmart Diet Deprivation\n\nFacebook\nPinterest\nInstagram\nJoin our newsletter\n\nFacebook\nPinterest\nInstagram\nJoin our newsletter\n\nThe information provided on this website (including the Blogs, Community pages, Program Materials and all other content) was originally intended for a US audience.

Here’s why:\n\nThere’s a strange disconnect in the online business world.\n\nOnline business owners tend to be introverts.\n\nI mean, really … it’s the perfect job for an introvert!\n\nYou can do your work all by yourself without needing to interact with a single person in real life. Your computer screen provides comfort and cover from the world outside your doors.\n\nAnd despite the fact that you’re working alone, your business can flourish.\n\nBut here’s the disconnect …\n\nTo really grow an online business, you have to be willing to step into the limelight and claim your authority.\n\nYou have to be willing to be a leader.\n\nWelcome to a discussion about online leadership — and how to embrace it\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about how to adapt a success mindset so you’re able to step into a leadership role in your online business naturally and with ease.\n\nBut more importantly, I’m going to show you how taking a leadership role will help you to create a business you’ll love — a business that may not look like anyone else’s, but that suits you 100%.\n\nHere’s why stepping into an online leadership role is crucial\n\n“Pamela, why are we talking about leadership?”\n\nI’ve been thinking about leadership a lot this year. I’ve realized that it’s an essential ingredient of online success that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe sooner you embrace your online leader role, the sooner you’ll enjoy these benefits:\n\nYou’ll feel poised and self-assured while doing all the promotional activities that come with owning an online business.\nYou’ll become comfortable being visible online in everything from a published blog post; an email inbox; a webinar; a live video; a podcast; a stage; and inside the pages of a book.\nYour business will grow, because the online world rewards people who confidently stand behind and in front of their businesses.\n\nI’m about to show you a path forward that even the most introverted among us can walk. It’s a way to gradually shift your success mindset so it includes opportunities to be the online leader your business needs.\n\nIf you …\n\nWant to share your expertise with the world — but you’re secretly terrified to “put yourself out there”\nFeel a deep desire to build a business that makes a difference but aren’t sure what it’s going to take\nWish you had tens of thousands of people in your audience — but are intimidated by those numbers at the same time\n\n… keep reading. I’m about to show you how to become an online business leader naturally and with less stress and fear.\n\nHow a success mindset helps you triumph online\n\nThis is the second article in a series about how to build an online business you’ll love.\n\nIn the first article, I talked about how online businesses are built in predictable stages.\n\nI shared a quiz that helps you pinpoint the stage you’re in now.\n\nThe BIG benefit of knowing your business-building stage?\n\nIt allows you to focus all your efforts on reaching the important milestones in that stage … and gives you permission to ignore the stages you’re not in right now.\n\nSay goodbye to that feeling of overwhelm you’ve been carrying around!\n\nTake a look if you haven’t read it yet: Why Some People Triumph Online and Others Never Make It\n\nToday, I’m going to build on what I shared in the first article by showing you how to shift your “success mindset” toward growth. I’m going to map out an easy path to becoming the online leader your business needs.\n\nI don’t see anyone else online talking about this, so today I’m breaking the silence!\n\nI think you’ll like what you’re about to learn. There’s a way to do this that’s not stressful and that builds naturally from one experience to another.\n\nMy goal with this article is to show you a way to become more comfortable standing both behind and in front of the online business you’re building. Ready?\n\nHave you experienced these “moments of personal growth?”\n\nAny time you’re building a business — online or offline — you’re going to experience some moments that cause you to … well, let’s say they cause you to grow as a person.\n\nThat’s putting a pleasant spin on it, isn’t it?\n\nMaybe you’ve experienced these moments before:\n\nYou’re putting together a first offer and then it hits you — “Oh, if I want people to buy this, I have to market it … not just now, but forever!”\nYou know that in order to reach prospects you’ve got to extend yourself. But yikes … outreach is so uncomfortable!\nYou’re given opportunities to be more visible — maybe it’s an interview request or a small speaking gig — and you’re terrified to say “yes.”\n\nIf you’ve experienced any of these challenging moments, guess what? You’re normal! And they help to form your success mindset.\n\nBut if you stay stuck in these moments and don’t move beyond them, your business won’t become what it can be.\n\nYour introverted side will stay cozy and comfortable, that’s for sure.\n\nBut you will always wonder, “What would have happened if I’d experienced the momentary discomfort and pushed past it?”\n\nThat’s what we’re going to cover here: a way to embrace a success mindset and push beyond the momentary discomfort so you can experience everything that’s waiting for you on the other side.\n\nBeware the deep end\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s talk about the deep end for a moment.\n\nThere are a lot of people online who are pushing their solutions for gaining visibility in your online business. They’re selling:\n\nCourses on writing a book\nWorkshops on becoming a highly paid speaker\nClasses on running successful webinars\n\nThese are all good things. They’re all things I’ve done myself! But if you take courses on doing these “deep end” things before you’ve done some of the “shallow end” things I’m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated — not inspired.\n\nAnd sadly, you may never take the first steps.\n\nThat’s what I’m about to cover … the first steps. They’re crucial!\n\nRead on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online leadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.\n\n1. Start small and recognize that no one is watching\n\nHere’s an analogy:\n\nWhen you’re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online businesses — planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft versions of both — there’s a helpful way to think about what you’re doing.\n\nImagine you’re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are drawn. No one in the audience can see what you’re doing back there!\n\nYou’re planning and building what you’ll reveal to the world — but you haven’t pulled back the curtains and invited them in.\n\nHere’s what I want you to remember …\n\nWhen you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat and sweat beading on your upper lip?\n\nNo one is watching.\n\nI mean, if you’re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience in the early days. But for the most part? There’s almost no one there.\n\nIt’s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer people watching your first visibility attempts, you won’t feel as intimidated by the process.\n\nSo start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section …\n\n2. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1\n\nA few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse’s Problogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was creating online “events” that build your audience.\n\nIn that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone.\n\nAnd I used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:\n\nIt got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is …\n\nIt’s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the more intimidating things.\n\nIncreasing your visibility gradually lets you grow into your online leadership role with much less stress. Click To Tweet\n\nEveryone’s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used to look like this:\n\nNOT SCARY\n\nWriting a blog post\nWriting a piece of email marketing\nSpeaking to someone on the phone\n\nKIND OF SCARY\n\nPublishing the blog post\nSending the piece of email marketing\nSpeaking to someone on a video call\n\nINTIMIDATING\n\nParticipating in a podcast interview\nSpeaking as a member of a panel\nPresenting a live webinar\n\nTERROR LEVEL 100\n\nDelivering the keynote speech at a conference\nHosting a live video on a social media platform\nPublishing and promoting a book\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI didn’t go from the Non-scary stuff to the Terror Level 100 list.\n\nInstead, I moved from the Non-scary to the Kind of Scary stuff. I mastered the Kind of Scary list and moved on to the Intimidating list. I got comfortable with the Intimidating list and found myself ready to tackle the Terror Level 100 list.\n\nAll the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more resilient.\n\nAs you push into your next level of discomfort, you’ll find yourself being asked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to write blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote addresses at their conferences.\n\nThe good news?\n\nYou’ll have a strong success mindset and you’ll be ready for it all.\n\n3. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindset\n\nWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.\n\nWe sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach across the world and draw an audience to us … without having to leave the comfort of our homes, if we don’t want to.\n\nBut sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role that will benefit you and your business.\n\nWhen it comes to moving yourself along the “visibility spectrum” toward a leadership role, it’s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive colleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your frustrations; and are generous with their support.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve reached out to colleagues and said something along the lines of …\n\n“Argh! I know I need to do this but it’s scary!”\n\nHaving a team of people around you that you can be “real” with is vital if you want to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.\n\nI’m very happy to say that a I’m building that team of people for you right now.\n\nIf you’d like to find out more about the BIG League — my community for online business builders — download the Online Business Success Roadmap. It’s the approach we follow in the program.\n\nHere’s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader your business needs\n\nLet’s quickly recap what we covered in this article:\n\nStart small and recognize that no one is watching. The early days are the perfect time to explore things that feel uncomfortable — your audience is small and you won’t feel as intimidated.\nDon’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1. Remember, online leadership and authoritative visibility exist on a spectrum. Move along it step-by-step and your confidence will grow naturally.\nGet support for the scary stuff. If you are truly committed to growth, consider joining a group where the other members will have your back and offer support when you’re about to take a big, scary step.\n\n“Become an online leader” sounds like a tall order. But it doesn’t have to be! Take it step-by-step and get support for the hard parts and you’ll get there before you know it.\n\nShare this information, please?\n\nA favor: would you take a moment to share this information?\n\nAs I said earlier, I don’t see anyone else talking about how building up to an online leadership role will grow your business — and how to do it with less stress.\n\nI’d really love to get this information out to more people, so if you can take a moment to share, I’d appreciate it.\n\nComing next: how to make Plan & Grow BIG work for your business\n\nIn the final article in this series, we’re going to dig deep into how the Plan & Grow BIG approach to building an online business really works — and how to put it to use in your business.\n\nIt’s all about finding your starting point and focusing on the milestones that are just ahead.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, I’ll show you the path to take to get your online business off to a great start.\nIf you’ve already built your online business but it hasn’t reached its full potential, you’ll discover some new ideas for skyrocketing your growth.\n\nGo forth and lead\n\nNow you know a natural progression you can use to step into an online leadership role that will grow your reach and your revenues.\n\n197 Shares\nBuffer\nShare\nPin\nTweet\nShare\nEmail\n\nOnline Business, Selling\nbusiness challenges, business journey\n\nPamela Wilson\n\nPamela Wilson is an online educator, author, keynote speaker, and the founder of BIG Brand System.

Fortunately I had already been blogging for 6 months before that on Blogger so writing posts was easy and once my website was up, I enjoyed looking at my Google Analytics (I had transferred my blog to the website by then).\n\nThe next scary step was learning to share my blog posts which was strange since I had no trouble getting on the phone to discuss business or going out and doing live workshops.\n\nI feel we all have our different comfort and dis-comfort zones and mapping a progressive journey that will build on our growing comfort level is important. Nowadays social sharing is fun and I’m looking out for other ways to share my message. Who would have thought things would become simpler?\n\nPamela Wilson\nAugust 22, 2018 at 7:19 am\n\nYes! We all have our own comfort/discomfort continuum, don’t we? And things definitely become simpler over time. It’s reassuring to know this — and something to look forward to.\n\nBo\nAugust 22, 2018 at 2:55 pm\n\nStepping out of my comfort level for sure today – doing a video interview in a couple of hours.\nYikes! My first one – I’m so not comfortable with video. Weird, because I never really minded speaking live to a (smallish) group.\n\nPamela Wilson\nAugust 22, 2018 at 5:21 pm\n\nGo for it, Bo! It definitely gets easier with practice.\n\nMary Collette Rogers\nAugust 26, 2018 at 9:16 pm\n\nI like the concept of talking about this in terms of “leadership,” rather than what a lot of gurus describe as becoming the “expert.” Leadership seems more achievable and realistic–you don’t have to come off as knowing everything, just someone who has explored an area deeply and wants to share and guide others on the same journey. Leadership can have a collaborative element in in that I like.\n\nPamela Wilson\nAugust 27, 2018 at 7:21 am\n\nI think the distinction is important, too, Mary Collette. A leader doesn’t have to know everything … a leader has to be willing to stand up and stand out for the good of the community!\n\nThanks for your comment. 🙂\n\nComments are closed.\n\nLearn More\n\nOnline Business Collection​\nBranding & Design Collection​\n\nStart Making More Sales: Remember This 5-Step Recipe for High-Converting Sales Pages\n\nFive Marketing Tips from the Bakery Down the Street\n\nWhy I Hate the Verdana Font\n\nPrev Business Focus: It’s Why Some People Triumph Online and Others Never Make It\nYou’re Ready for the BIG League, and It’s Ready for You Next\nSearch for:\n\nBlog homepage\n\n© Zurek Design LLC — Read our fascinating terms of service.\n\nClick to watch free on-demand training about online business and visual marketing.\n\nFree Courses\n\nVisual Marketing Workshop\nOnline Business Workshop\nFree Roadmap\n\nBooks\n\nAll BIG Brand Books\nMaster Content Marketing\nMaster Content Strategy\nZero to Book Podcast\n\nFree Articles\n\nOnline Business\nBranding & Design\nAll Articles\n\nAbout\n\nCoaching Programs\nSpeaking\nContact\n\nMenu\n\nFree Courses\n\nVisual Marketing Workshop\nOnline Business Workshop\nFree Roadmap\n\nBooks\n\nAll BIG Brand Books\nMaster Content Marketing\nMaster Content Strategy\nZero to Book Podcast\n\nFree Articles\n\nOnline Business\nBranding & Design\nAll Articles\n\nAbout\n\nCoaching Programs\nSpeaking\nContact\n\n© All rights reserved | Terms\n\nTwitter Facebook Pinterest Instagram\n\nNeed a hand?\n\nWatch a free workshop now.

Nelson won it when he fired a shot at Matt Murray that trickled to the goaltender's right. Nelson tapped the rebound into the open net for his sixth goal of the season.\n\nAnthony Beauvillier added his seventh for the Islanders, and Semyon Varlamov stopped 27 shots as New York improved to 14-0-1 in its last 15 games.\n\nWild 4, Sabres 1: Zach Parise scored twice, Alex Stalock made 30 saves and Minnesota beat Buffalo. Jason Zucker had a goal and an assist, and Jonas Brodin also scored for the Wild, who improved to 4-2-1 in their last seven. Brandon Montour scored for the Sabres and Linus Ullmark stopped 22 shots. Buffalo is on a 1-6-2 skid and battling injuries at the forward position following 9-2-1 start.\n\nBruins 5, Devils 1: David Pastrnak and Matt Grzelcyk scored two goals apiece, and Brad Marchand added three assists to lead Boston. Tuukka Rask made 25 saves and New Jersey native Connor Clifton added a goal as the Bruins beat the Devils for the eighth time in nine meetings. Blake Coleman scored for New Jersey, which was looking for its first three-game winning streak since December 2018.\n\nPanthers 5, Flyers 2: Aleksander Barkov and Brett Connolly each had a goal and an assist to lift Florida. Jonathan Huberdeau, Colton Sceviour and Mike Hoffman also scored and Evgenii Dadonov had two assists. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 35 shots. The Panthers are 6-2-1 in their past nine games.\n\nBlue Jackets 5, Canadiens 2: Pierre-Luc Dubois had two goals and an assist, rookie Emil Bemstrom added a goal and an assist, and Columbus beat Montreal. Joonas Korpisalo stopped 30 shots for his eighth win as Columbus improved to 8-8-4. Eric Robinson and Boone Jenner also scored for the Blue Jackets. Artturi Lehkonen and Joel Armia had the goals for the Canadiens.\n\nSenators 4, Red Wings 3: Anthony Duclair had two goals and an assist, and Ottawa held on to beat Detroit. John Gabriel Pageau and Brady Tkachuk also scored for Ottawa. Anders Nilsson made 35 saves, including 15 in the third period when the Senators were outshot 16-3. Valtteri Filppula had a goal and an assist, and Robby Fabbri and Anthony Mantha scored for Detroit, which ended a five-game point streak (3-0-2).\n\nJets 2, Predators 1: Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers scored, Connor Hellebuyck made 38 saves and Winnipeg defeated Nashville. The teams are heading in opposite directions in the tough Central Division. Winnipeg has won three in a row and five of six. The reeling Predators have lost five straight.\n\nBlues 3, Lightning 1: Oskar Sundqvist and David Perron scored to lead St. Louis past Tampa Bay, spoiling Pat Maroon's much-anticipated return after helping his hometown team to a Stanley Cup title last season. Maroon, a St. Louis native, made his first trip back to the city since signing a one-year contract with the Lightning in the offseason.\n\nHurricanes 4, Blackhawks 2: Nino Niederreiter had a goal and an assist, and Carolina beat Chicago for their fourth straight victory.\n\nNew York Islanders' Brock Nelson (29) puts the game-winning overtime goal behind Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Matt Murray (30) during an NHL hockey game in Pittsburgh, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019.

Hathaway was given a match penalty for spitting on Anaheim defenseman Erik Gudbranson in a brawl during the Capitals' 5-2 victory Monday. That carries with it an automatic suspension pending a review by the NHL, and it is likely the Capitals won't have Hathaway in the lineup Wednesday night in New York against the Rangers.\n\nMost Popular\n\n1\n\nFire damages Fort Orange Club in Albany\n\n2\n\nBest of the Capital Region 2019: Pizza\n\n3\n\nPhotos: Crossgates Mall through the years\n\n4\n\nAlbany boutique hotel will be blast from past, with modern comforts\n\n5\n\nChurchill: Elise Stefanik's rise and possible fall\n\n6\n\nSenator cancels Binghamton University visit as political unrest rattles campus\n\n7\n\nCapital Region's first Costco proposed for entrance to Crossgates\n\nView Comments\n© 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc.\nLogo Return to Top\n\nAbout\n\nAdvertising\nInterest Based Ads\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Notice\nYour California Privacy Rights\nContact Us\nOur Company\nJobs at the TU\n\nContent\n\nBlogs\nWeather\nSchool Closings\nEvents Calendar\nWeddings/Celebrations\nBirths\nObituaries\nOnline Store\nPuzzles Palace\nSavings Source\n\nConnect\n\nAndroid App\niOS App\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nInstagram\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscriber Services\nHome Delivery\nBecome a Carrier\niPad app\nCopyright and Reprint\neEdition\n\nHearst Newspapers © Copyright The Hearst Corporation"

James was more surprised than thrilled by his latest statistical achievement, particularly while a different statistic glared at him from the box score.\n\n“Coach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, 'Congratulations,' and I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers,” James said. “I really don't know what to think about it. I just think it's a pretty cool stat to know, and I'm glad it happened in a win.”\n\nLos Angeles Lakers' LeBron James dunks during the first half of the team's NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, in Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles Lakers' LeBron James dunks during the first half of the team's NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, in Los Angeles.\nPhoto: Ringo H.W.

Chiu, AP\nLeBron sets triple-double mark, Lakers hold off OKC 112-107\n1 / 4\nBack to Gallery\n\nJames has five triple-doubles in the Lakers’ last 10 games, getting four in victories. There’s a reason for this spree: Although James has constantly filled the stat sheet since he joined the league in 2003, he is leading the NBA this season with 11.1 assists per game, nearly four more than his career average. He has at least 10 assists in six consecutive games, the longest streak of his career.\n\nVogel has put the ball in James’ hands constantly on offense, and his playmaking acumen has grown along with his chemistry with Davis, as they demonstrated repeatedly against the Thunder. Seven of LeBron’s assists came on baskets by Davis.\n\n“Amazing,” Davis said. “To be able to do that against every team is something special. I mean, (it’s) trippy that he’s been playing for a long time, so it was a matter of time before it happened, but just a tribute to all his hard work.”\n\nJames is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in front of him — Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson and Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd — hadn’t done it against 30 teams. Kidd, who did it against 28 teams, has served as a role model for James’ efforts as a tall point guard.\n\n“He’s just playing terrific basketball,” Vogel said. “For him to be doing what he’s doing in his 17th year is just nothing short of remarkable. There’s no reason to believe he can’t sustain that for the rest of the season and help us make a real strong playoff push.”\n\nDennis Schröder scored 20 of his season-high 31 points in a phenomenal first half for the Thunder, who have lost four of five despite two solid performances at Staples Center. Danilo Gallinari added 25 points in his former home arena, and Nerlens Noel had 15.\n\n“That’s why (James) is considered probably the best of all time, but I think we did a great job on him,” Schröder said. “They obviously hit some tough shots.”\n\nOne night after the Thunder barely missed an upset win over the Clippers thanks to a last-minute 3-pointer by former star Paul George, Oklahoma City couldn’t quite catch up to the powerful Lakers despite keeping the game close all night.\n\n“There’s a lot of things we did well in there,” Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said. “But, you know, we came up short in all these games. I think the one sign you can point to is both teams, the Clippers and the Lakers, are really, really good teams, so we’re competing well at a high level. But we’ve just got to do more in order to be able to finish and close out games.”\n\nThe Thunder won’t have to wait long for a rematch: These teams meet again in Oklahoma City in three days.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nThunder: F Hamidou Diallo missed his third straight game with a left knee sprain. ... Schröder got a technical foul in the third quarter for confronting Davis at the free throw line after Davis dunked and was fouled.\n\nLakers: Kyle Kuzma left the court in the second quarter with an eye abrasion after teenager Darius Bazley hit him in the right side of his face with an elbow on a drive. Kuzma returned to the bench in the second half, but with obvious damage above his eye. He didn’t return to the game, although Vogel said he was available if necessary. The Lakers plan to re-evaluate him within the next 24 hours.\n\nCLOSEOUT SEQUENCE\n\nJames’ 3-pointer put the Lakers up 109-98 with 3:08 to play, but the Thunder scored nine straight points to cut the Lakers’ lead to two on Gallinari’s free throws with 1:24 left.\n\nAfter Danny Green got a key offensive rebound for the Lakers, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drilled a 3-pointer with 55 seconds left. James missed two free throws moments later to keep the Thunder in it, but Oklahoma City couldn’t score again.\n\nPOINT GUARDS BEHAVE\n\nChris Paul had four points, 10 assists and five rebounds for the Thunder, and he didn’t appear to clash with Rajon Rondo, his opponent in a fight early last season while he was with the Rockets. Rondo had eight points and a season-high 10 assists.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThunder: Host the Lakers on Friday.\n\nLakers: Visit the Thunder on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSchool Score Database\n\nWorld Cup 2018 Video\n\nFrance v.

(AP) — A cat who has been missing for five years in Portland, Oregon, has been found in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nThe Santa Fe Animal Shelter announced this week that Sasha the black cat was recently found wandering the streets of New Mexico’s capital. Officials said a scan of the cat's microchip revealed that the kitty had traveled more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) from Oregon.\n\nAmerican Airlines offered to fly the cat to Portland, along with a member of the Santa Fe Animal Shelter. Officials will present the animal to Viktor Usov, the cat’s original owner.\n\nUsov says the family thought they’d never see the cat again.\n\nMost Popular\n\n1\n\nThousands of Disney Plus accounts were hacked and sold online for as little as $3\n\n2\n\nMan charged with manslaughter in friend's shooting death\n\n3\n\nMan bludgeoned to death Monday identified\n\n4\n\nDrag queen denied entrance at Austin Whataburger following city's drag festival\n\n5\n\nDowntown San Antonio park will become 'Fantasyland' for the holidays\n\n6\n\nWoman notices daughter who went missing for months on TV\n\n7\n\nKanye West, Kim Kardashian and kids spotted at The Galleria ahead of Lakewood appearance\n\n8\n\n'Sick and terrible': VH1 reality show slammed for including El Chapo's wife\n\n9\n\nS.A. is warm but rain and chills are coming\n\n10\n\nCrash leads police to finding shooting victim inside car\n\n11\n\nJ.J.

Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.\n\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds.\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)\nRead More\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\n\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.\n\nSearch\n\nWorld\n\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nChina\nEurope\nIndia\nMiddle East\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUS Politics\n\n45\nCongress\nSCOTUS\nFacts First\n2020\n2019 Elections\n\nBusiness\n\nMarkets\nTech\nMedia\nSuccess\nPerspectives\nVideos\n\nHealth\n\nFood\nFitness\nWellness\nParenting\nVital Signs\n\nEntertainment\n\nStars\nScreen\nBinge\nCulture\nMedia\n\nTech\n\nInnovate\nGadget\nMission: Ahead\nUpstarts\nWork Transformed\nInnovative Cities\n\nStyle\n\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nAutos\nVideo\n\nTravel\n\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nPlay\nStay\nVideos\n\nSports\n\nFootball\nTennis\nEquestrian\nGolf\nSkiing\nHorse Racing\nMotorsport\nSailing\nRugby\nFormula E\nEsports\n\nVideos\n\nLive TV\nDigital Studios\nCNN Films\nHLN\nTV Schedule\nTV Shows A-Z\nCNNVR\n\nFeatures\n\nFreedom Project\nImpact Your World\nInside Africa\n2 Degrees\nCNN Heroes\nAll Features\n\nMore\n\nPhotos\nLongform\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\n\nFollow CNN Politics\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility & CC\nAdChoices\nAbout Us\nModern Slavery Act Statement\nAdvertise with us\nCNN Store\nNewsletters\nTranscripts\nLicense Footage\nCNN Newsource\nSitemap\n\n© 2019 Cable News Network.

(Source: NASA)\n\nBy HNN Staff | November 18, 2019 at 2:26 PM HST - Updated November 18 at 4:46 PM\n\nHONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - NASA scientists using a telescope atop Mauna Kea have confirmed the presence of water vapor on the surface of Europa, one of Jupiter’s 79 moons.\n\nThe find almost certainly means the moon has liquid water, an essential ingredient for life.\n\nIn fact, scientists believe that there’s a liquid water ocean on Europa beneath a miles-thick ice shell that has twice as much water as all of the oceans on Earth.\n\nLucas Paganini, a NASA planetary scientist who led the water detection investigation, said two of the three requirements for life ― essential chemical elements and sources of energy ― are found all over the solar systems. \"But the third — liquid water — is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,” he said.\n\nFinding water vapor on Europa, he said, is the “next best thing” to liquid water.\n\nThe discovery was announced in an article published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nPaganini and his team reported that they detected 5,200 pounds of water vapor being released from Europa per second. That’s enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.\n\nEuropa ― located some 390 million miles away ― is slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon.\n\nCopyright 2019 Hawaii News Now.

Adam Schiff speaks during a media briefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, October 31, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nTime is not on Adam Schiff’s side.\n\nA dam Schiff’s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\n\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza, Trump’s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better the optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity when Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after all, was again to drive down Trump’s popularity and render him politically inert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation, following the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill. Once Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff’s gold-standard whistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy leaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on those who put him up to this present circus.\n\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his own presidential call — Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the deep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on the presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their dishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff’s own doubling-down admission that he didn’t know the name of the whistleblower. After previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower (“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower”) — he now ups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower will testify under oath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff’s astounding assertion that he doesn’t know the whistleblower’s name is as hard to believe as Robert Mueller’s own congressional testimony that he was not familiar with Fusion GPS — the font of the entire Steele dossier that itself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller’s own appointment.\n\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special prosecutor’s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a veritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to find either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in the 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and $35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or findings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the entire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional testimony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, the country would not put up with yet another special prosecutor entrusted to investigate “Ukrainian collusion.” They would know the post-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington “wise man” icon would follow the Mueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable crimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton’s bought-and-paid-for Christopher Steele.\n\nMost of Schiff’s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same critical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that Trump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless policy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that Trump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently their supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should supersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were abjectly silent during the Obama administration when the “reset” proved to be virtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered the Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when Obama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took over as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine’s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have targeted his own morally compromised son.\n\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration that at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping sanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out of the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO defense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment of Russia, and arming Ukraine?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at the Obama National Security Council gone to the IG — but only after first consulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes — to claim third-hand knowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia’s President Medvedev? The Bush-era whistleblower, a protégé of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would then have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in the call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile defense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give “space” to Obama before the 2012 election — with “space” perhaps defined as the Russians keeping quiet and making Obama’s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up to Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama? Would Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the “whistleblower’s” identity secret?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing the American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no Nixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term president could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to abort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber impeachment.\n\nDay-by-day Schiff’s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news blackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the 2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be presidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved peripheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of the suffocated Beto O’Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\n\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as it promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked of infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug prescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another of attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an incompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let him ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\n\nIronically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he’ll grow stronger and dominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get attention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and crazier — from Bernie Sanders’s declaring an end to all deportations to Elizabeth Warren’s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to pay for “Medicare for all.” What will happen when these barnstorming senators are trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\n\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of Michael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise James Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative. Horowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well proceed with indictments — at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the nation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a special counsel.\n\nSchiff is also risking Trump exhaustion — the magical point at which the public tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the Electoral College–subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment, the Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns, recession, and now Ukraine — seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage and celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump. In other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets to Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, “Enough already, just vote.”\n\nVoters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the more the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears, and scream, “Make Trump just go away.” But the opposite is more likely: At some point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public enemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In the final scene from Braveheart, the once-hated Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured before an English crowd\n\nthat’s hissing and calling for more blood — up until a point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the kings’ torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-Scottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling “Mercy!”\n\nSo too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long presidential abortion, and attacked Trump’s wife, children, family, businesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at what point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged vituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive enemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\n\nIt is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam Schiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes before the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the more he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised. And the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\n\nIn just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his staff’s prior contacts with the “whistleblower,” read into the record a complete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly secret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one sees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him — including his own party’s presidential candidates.\n\nNancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the debates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and Durham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking gun, and before Trump’s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just wants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his career as the icon of current progressivism.\n\nComments\n\nWhen Democratic inquisitors are reduced to lecturing the nation that “ hearsay can be much better evidence than direct ” testimony, and when Adam Schiff looks into the cameras and swears he has no idea who the whistleblower is, then it’s time to pack up the circus and leave town.\n\nComments\n\nSomething to Consider\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

Kathrin Ziegler/Getty\n\nRetiring early takes time and incredible discipline.\nIf you're planning to retire early, you should aim to have at least 25 to 30 times your estimated annual expenses saved or invested, though that number may be lower or higher depending on the lifestyle you envision.\nDepending on how much you plan to spend annually, you'll generally fall into one of three FIRE (financial independence, retire early) categories: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE.\nTo achieve your target number, live below your means, increase your income, and max out your retirement accounts.\nYou should also aim to pay off all high-interest debt before retiring, which may include paying off your mortgage early. And don't forget to make a backup plan.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\n\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In general, here are the steps you can take:\n\nHow to retire early\n\n1. Define early retirement\n\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\n\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\n2. Take inventory\n\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n\n3. Establish your target number\n\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\n\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \" Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\n\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n4. Live below your means\n\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\n\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n\n5. Leverage your income\n\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\n\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\n\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\n\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at any time.\n\n7. Invest the money that's left over\n\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\n\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\n\nNeed help crunching the numbers? SmartAsset's free tool can help find a licensed professional near you »\n\n8. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\n\nTommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\n9. Research your options for health insurance\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n\n10. Make a backup plan\n\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n11. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\n\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\n\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"\n\nRelated coverage from How to Do Everything: Money:\n\nHere's exactly how to figure out when you can retire\n\nHow to invest in real estate to make money and build wealth\n\nHow to get COBRA health insurance if you lose your job or retire early\n\nHow to invest in index funds, explained\n\nMehr: How to retire early Early retirement Retiring early Your Money Saving\nPersonal Finance How To Personal Finance Insider pfi PFI-XAMP PFI SmartAsset Retirement\n\nfacebook\nlinkedin\ntwitter\nemail\nprint\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\nTanza Loudenback\nHow to retire early,Early retirement,Retiring early,Your Money Saving,Personal Finance How To,Personal Finance Insider,pfi,PFI-XAMP,PFI SmartAsset,Retirement\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n2019-11-13T23:06:00+01:00\n2019-07-02T22:14:45+02:00\n2019-11-13T23:06:08+01:00\nhttps://static6.businessinsider.de/image/5d1ce1ae2516e9500e130fa8-500-250/how-to-retire-early-so-you-can-work-travel-and-relax-on-your-own-schedule.jpg\n500\n250\nBusinessInsiderDe\nhttps://www.businessinsider.de/assets/images/logos/og-image-logo.png\nRetiring early takes time and incredible discipline.

You should also aim to pay off all high-interest debt before retiring, which may include paying off your mortgage early. And don't forget to make a backup plan. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can. That said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In general, here are the steps you can take: How to retire early 1. Define early retirement Retiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between. The first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time. 2. Take inventory Leif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances. \"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\" \"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\" 3. Establish your target number After outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality. Early retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals. This part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want. 4. Live below your means It's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively. Focusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate. Depending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person. Regular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year. 5. Leverage your income It's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said. Sabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote. 6. Max out your retirement accounts There's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts. Employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return. The only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at any time. 7. Invest the money that's left over If you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it. Many early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk. Need help crunching the numbers?

If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off In preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns. Tommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring. \"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote. 9. Research your options for health insurance Leaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan. Otherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job. 10. Make a backup plan No matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line. 11. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too Time and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can. As early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\" Related coverage from How to Do Everything: Money: Here's exactly how to figure out when you can retire How to invest in real estate to make money and build wealth How to get COBRA health insurance if you lose your job or retire early How to invest in index funds, explained\ninternational\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\nTanza Loudenback\nHow to retire early,Early retirement,Retiring early,Your Money Saving,Personal Finance How To,Personal Finance Insider,pfi,PFI-XAMP,PFI SmartAsset,Retirement\nHow to retire early so you can work, travel, and relax on your own schedule\n2019-11-13T23:06:00+01:00\n2019-11-13T23:06:08+01:00\nhttps://static6.businessinsider.de/image/5d1ce1ae2516e9500e130fa8-500-250/how-to-retire-early-so-you-can-work-travel-and-relax-on-your-own-schedule.jpg\n500\n250\nBusinessInsiderDe\nhttps://www.businessinsider.de/assets/images/logos/og-image-logo.png\nRetiring early takes time and incredible discipline.

Why You Shouldn’t Worry.\n\nBy\nAl Root\nUpdated Nov. 19, 2019 8:21 am ET / Original Nov. 19, 2019 8:02 am ET\n\nOrder Reprints\nPrint Article\n\nText size\n\nHome Depot stock fell after the retailer reported third-quarter earnings. Photograph by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nShares of construction goods giant Home Depot are dropping in premarket trading after the company cut full-year sales growth guidance. But its lowered forecast isn’t a problem for the overall market, according to Wall Street. That’s good news for investors.\n\nHome Depot (ticker: HD) reported $2.53 in per-share earnings for the third quarter. Wall Street predicted $2.52 a share. The results look OK, but the stock was down 5% in recent trading. Company management said comparable-store sales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%.\n\n“Our third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business, yet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,” said CEO Craig Menear in the company’s news release. “We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.”\n\nOne Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a “seamless, interconnected shopping experience” for customers.\n\nIn a research report early Tuesday, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said the market is misinterpreting the results. That creates a buying opportunity, according to the analyst. “Comp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations,” wrote Matuszewski. “We interpret lighter [second-half] results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments versus a softer macro picture.”\n\nHe’s not the only one who isn’t all that worried. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem points out a couple of additional reasons investors shouldn’t fret. “While certainly a disappointing result, we note that [the company] faced a [0.6% to 0.7%] hurricane headwind in Q3, lumber remains deeply deflationary and Canada a net headwind,” wrote Fadem in a Tuesday research report. “Excluding these items, we believe Q3 comps would have been closer to 5%.”\n\nStill, the stock has slid, and peer Lowe’s (LOW) stock is off too, down 1.8%. Lowe’s reports earnings Wednesday.\n\nHome Depot management hosts a conference call at 9 a.m. ET to discuss results with analysts and investors.\n\nHome Depot shares are up about 40% year to date, easily outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 over the same span.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com\n\nClose\n\nHome Depot Stock Is Falling After Its Earnings Release.

В отличие от всех без исключения остальных диет, диета Аткинса учитывает индивидуальные особенности именно вашего организма. По сути, диета Аткинса представляет из себя комплекс из собственно диеты и системы питания, (сама диета проводится один раз, а система питания удерживает ваш вес в рамках дозволенного).\n\nЭтой диете с успехом следую зарубежные и отечественные знаменитости и видные политические деятели. Тот же принцип использует и знаменитая кремлевская диета. Идеолог диеты, доктор Аткинс, в обязательном порядке требует полное воздержание от каких либо лекарств в период первых двух недель диеты - что, скорее всего, потребует консультации с врачом. Ограничение углеводов в диете будет подразумевать снижение сахара в крови - что так же требует консультации у врача.\n\nДиета противопоказана: при беременности - может неблагоприятно сказаться на ребенке, при кормлении грудью - та же причина, имеются почечная недостаточность - колебания уровня сахара и ряд других.\n\nДиета Аткинса является двухфазной - в первую фазу, продолжительность которой 14 дней, ваш организм будет получать минимально необходимое количество углеводов - что позволит выравнивать баланс калорий за счет расходования внутренних ресурсов из жировых отложений - максимальное снижение веса. По истечении 14 дней ограничение на калорийность продуктов снимается, но остается ограничение на количество углеводов - в этом сложность диеты - максимальное значение определяется индивидуально исходя из особенностей вашего организма - постоянный контроль веса и коррекция баланса углеводов практически на протяжении всей жизни.\n\nНа протяжении двух первых недель количество углеводов не должно превышать 20 грамм в сутки. Среднее значение этого параметра для большинства людей составляет около 40 граммов (превышение приведет к ожирению - что и имеет место быть для большинства людей с избыточным весом - потребляемые одновременно углеводы и жиры не усваиваются одинаково - углеводы как энергетический источник полностью расходуются на поддержание сегодняшних потребностей, а часть жиров запасается - если имел место быть их излишек - наш организм только их и способен запасать - такова наша физиология).\n\nЦифра в 20 грамм легко достижима - это всего-навсего 3 чайных ложки сахарного песка в чай или сдобная булочка - поэтому никакого быстрого питания и перекусов. Для предотвращения таких ситуаций составлен список разрешенных всегда и в любом количестве (условно) продуктов - понятно, что подразумевается ваша инициативность - никаких излишеств - кушаем только тогда, когда появилось устойчивое чувство голода - никаких чипсов за сериалами.\n\nСписок разрешенных продуктов в меню диеты Аткинса:\n\nлюбая рыба (и морская и речная)\nлюбая птица (включая дичь)\nлюбые морепродукты (ограничение по количеству на устрицы - но лучше заранее рассчитать рецепт)\nв любом виде яйца (можно и куриные и перепелиные)\nлюбой твердый сыр (на некоторые сорта ограничение по количеству - заранее рассчитать рецепт)\nвсе типы овощей (употребление которых можно в сыром виде)\nлюбые свежие грибы\n\nДополнительное ограничение - нельзя за один прием пищи употреблять дневную норму углеводов в сочетании и с белками (птица, мясо) и с жирами. Необходимо выдержать интервал в 2 часа. На сочетание белки и жиры этого ограничения нет.\n\nСписок запрещенных продуктов:\n\nалкоголь в любом виде\nжиры искусственного происхождения\nсахар в любом виде (иначе выйдите за пределы дневной нормы по другим продуктам)\nфрукты (во всех большое содержание углеводов - даже в среднем лимоне их почти 5 грамм)\nовощи с большим содержанием крахмала (картофель, кукуруза - рассчитать рецепт)\nкондитерские изделия (все содержат сахар)\nхлебобулочные изделия (большое содержание крахмала)\n\nСписок продуктов с ограничением по количеству\n\nкапуста\nкабачок\nгорох\nпомидоры\nлук\nсметана (низкокалорийный аналог сметаны) и ряд других продуктов.\n\nПить можно и обычную, и минеральную воду, и чай, и кофе, и Coca-Cola Light - любой напиток без углеводов (например, стакан виноградного сока содержит почти 30 грамм углеводов - а это явный перебор суточной нормы).\n\nВторая фаза диеты Аткинса\n\nВторая фаза диеты еще более простая - организм уже привыкает к ряду ограничений, и обмен веществ переориентирован на расходование внутренних жировых резервов.\n\nДопустимая суточная норма углеводов приближается примерно к 40 граммам (для каждого человека индивидуально). Но теперь требуется постоянный контроль веса - снижение жировых отложений будет продолжаться (но несколько медленнее). Как только достигните оптимального для вас веса можно понемногу добавлять в меню углеводные продукты - пока вес не начнет увеличиваться - это и будет ваш индивидуальный уровень углеводов (максимальный именно для вас). В дальнейшем перейдете этот уровень - начнете набирать вес - и наоборот.\n\nКонечно, в дальнейшем, скорее всего вы допустите некоторые излишества по объективным причинам - например, поездка на отдых, сопровождаемая алкоголем - понятно, что наберете небольшой излишний вес - уменьшите потребление углеводов до 20 грамм в сутки - как в первой фазе - пока не приведете свой вес к норме.\n\nДостоинства диеты Аткинса\n\nС одной стороны диета крайне простая и легко выполнимая - ограничения несущественны и легко выполнимы. Разрешенные диетой продукты включают продукты, полностью запрещенные в других диетах (сметана, яйца, сыр, мясо и мясные изделия). Диета Аткинса высокоэффективная - следуя ее рекомендациям, вы медленно, но верно будете сбрасывать вес до нормы. Несомненным плюсом диеты Аткинса является нормализация режима питания и обмена веществ. Сюда же нужно отнести и отсутствие ограничений на число и время приемов пищи.\n\nНедостатки диеты Аткинса\n\nДиета Аткинса не является полностью сбалансированной (но в этом плане она в разы превосходит другие диеты) - возможно, может потребоваться дополнительный прием витамино-минеральных комплексов. Минусом диеты Аткинса является ее продолжительность - всю жизнь контролировать баланс углеводов. Конечно, отрицательно для этой диеты сказывается и необходимость предварительного расчета рецептов по таблицам.\n\nОтзывы\n\nДобавить отзыв\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nСамые популярные диеты\n\nБелковая диета\nПопулярная диета при активном ритме жизни.

Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so far this year.\n\nMatt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky bet with a worthy reward.\n\n\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\" Maley said on CNBC's \" Trading Nation\" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years, down well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that multiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above $13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice higher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the upside.\"\n\n\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in the early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more upside potential,\" Maley said.\n\nThe Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-facing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.\n\n\"Here's a company that's willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers that Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new paradigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know, has been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce because shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the same segment.\n\nCoty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner's beauty and cosmetics portfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a partnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That relationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth for Ulta.\n\n\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be the new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with key influencers,\" Petrides said.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nRelated Tags\n\nRetail industry\nUlta Beauty Inc\nEstee Lauder\nKylie Jenner\nMatt Maley\n\nRelated\n\nThis economic trend could revive recession fears\nOne of the top-performing beauty stocks could surge after 'Kylie Jenner' makeover\nHere's where two traders say to invest with the stock market at record highs\nKohl's and Macy's are tanking — four investors weigh in on the retail wreck\nThis is the best stock to play catch-up to the Dow record rally, traders agree\n\nMore In Trading Nation\n\nThis top banking stock could be the best way to play the financials rally\nKeris Lahiff\nKohl's and Macy's are tanking — four investors weigh in on the retail wreck\nToussaint Campbell\nThis economic trend could hurt Wall Street's bullishness and revive recession fears\nStephanie Landsman\nRead More\n\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO\nLicensing & Reprints\nJoin the CNBC Panel\nSupply Chain Values\nAdvertise With Us\nClosed Captioning\nDigital Products\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nNews Releases\nInternships\nCorrections\nAbout CNBC\nAdChoices\nSite Map\nContact\nCareers\nHelp\n\nNews Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
