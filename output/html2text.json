He didn’t get it.Credit...Doug\nMills/The New York Times\n\nAmericans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major,\nstatewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature;\nin Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the\ngovernor’s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\n“Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!”\nTrump tweeted before Election Day. “Matt has my Complete and Total\nEndorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT\nGovernor, @MattBevin!”\n\nTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. “Virginia, with\nall of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with\neverything planned, go out and vote Republican today,” he said.\n\n“The people of this country aren’t buying” impeachment, Trump said at a rally\nin Louisiana last week. “You see it because we’re going up and they’re going\ndown.”\n\n“You gotta give me a big win please,” he said later. “Please.”\n\nTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead,\nthey did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the\nfirst time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky\nDemocrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in\n2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state\nTrump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points.\nDemocrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of\nvictory — their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half\npoints, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant\nwon in a landslide.\n\nIt’s true that Democrats didn’t run on the issue of impeachment. These races\nwere centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and\neducation. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where\nhealth care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy\nBeshear — whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act\nin the state — promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for\nwork requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the\nMedicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000\nstate residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well,\nwhere an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the\nexpansion.\n\nBut just because no one ran on impeachment doesn’t mean it wasn’t in the air.\nVoters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They\ncould have elevated the president’s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an\nunambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president’s\nimmediate political fortunes.\n\nTo start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows\nmajority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that\n“President Trump’s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House\nand removed from office by the Senate.” And an overwhelming 70 percent of\nAmericans say that the inciting offense — Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine\ninto investigating a political rival — was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters\npoll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the\nHouse to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most\nAmericans want Congress to investigate Trump if he “committed impeachable\noffenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.”\n\nWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have\nlimited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these\nnumbers and election results as vindication — proof that Democrats were right\nto take a narrow, focused approach to the president’s wrongdoing.\n\nBut it’s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the\ntable — that there’s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that\ntackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president’s\nphone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not\njust the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a\nclassified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and\nSaudi Arabia. These wouldn’t be fishing expeditions — given the president’s\nrefusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from\nthose of the state, there’s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior\nacross a range of areas — but they would mean a longer process. Democrats\ncouldn’t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to\nlet it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate,\nremember, took more than two years to unfold.)\n\nI don’t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch\nMcConnell’s hands until there’s a comprehensive case against the president.\nYes, there’s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is\nany prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage\nover the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance,\nespecially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would\nalso allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to\ncampaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a\ntrial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full\ntruth of what’s been happening in the White House under the guise of making\nAmerica great again.\n\n _The Times is committed to publishing_ _a diversity of letters_ _to the\neditor.

Auto Show\n\n1 /  23\n\nBack to Gallery\n\nNew electric vehicles, several new small SUVs, a redesigned compact car, a\nplug-in version of Toyota’s top-selling vehicle and a futuristic electric\nstation wagon concept car from Volkswagen are among the new models on display\nthis week at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\nToyota is displaying a rechargeable hybrid version of the RAV4 — the top-\nselling vehicle in the U.S. that’s not a pickup truck — while Ford is rolling\nout an all-new electric SUV that carries the Mustang performance car brand\nname. There also is a redesigned compact Sentra from Nissan.\n\nThe show opens to the public on Friday. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nNISSAN SENTRA\n\nNissan is hoping a sleek redesign of the Sentra compact sedan will pull in\nmore buyers in a struggling segment of the U.S. market.\n\nThe 2020 Sentra, which goes on sale in late January, loses the old version’s\nupright econobox look. It’s built on new underpinnings that lower it two\ninches and make it two inches wider than the outgoing model. It’s got a coupe\nlook that mimics the design of newer Nissan models like the Altima and Maxima.\nThe new version gets a new 149 horsepower, 2-liter four-cylinder engine that’s\n20% more powerful than the current model, yet Nissan says it will offer better\ngas mileage. It also gets a new rear suspension and steering system to improve\nhandling. Even though it’s an entry-level car, it comes standard with six\nsafety systems including automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection.\nPrice and gas mileage were not announced.\n\nVOLKSWAGEN ID. SPACE VIZZION CONCEPT\n\nVolkswagen is giving us a glimpse into the car of the future with a low-slung\nelectric station wagon called the ID. Space Vizzion Concept.\n\nThe German automaker, which has focused on electric vehicles after its diesel\nemissions-cheating scandal, says the wagon will be able to go 300 miles on a\nsingle battery charge. It has a rear-mounted 275-horsepower motor, but a\nsecond motor could be installed for all-wheel-drive, giving the car 355\nhorsepower. The all-wheel-drive version will be able to go from zero to 60 mph\n(97 kph) in five seconds, Volkswagen says. To limit wind drag, the car has\ntouch surfaces on the doors in place of conventional door handles. An\naugmented reality 15.6-inch touch screen that appears to float in the air has\nall entertainment, climate control and online information. VW says the car is\na preview of a production vehicle for North America and Europe, but it didn’t\nsay when the wagon will go on sale.\n\nFORD MUSTANG MACH E\n\nFord will display its first all-electric SUV, marking the start of an\navalanche of battery-powered vehicles coming from mainstream and luxury\nautomakers during the next two years that industry analysts say will boost\nelectric vehicle sales.\n\nAnalysts expect the number of electric vehicles for sale in the U.S. to grow\nfrom 16 currently to as many as 80 by 2022. They say the increased selection\nand longer range of the new vehicles will make them more popular.\n\nFord’s Mustang Mach E SUV will go 230 miles to more 300 miles per charge\ndepending on how it’s equipped. It will start at $44,000, not including a\n$7,500 federal tax credit.\n\nThe car gets some Mustang styling cues including triple taillights, a fastback\nrear and a long hood. A performance GT version will be able to go from zero to\n60 mph (97 kph) in about 3.5 seconds.\n\nThe Mach E was unveiled Sunday night ahead of the Los Angeles show.\n\nTOYOTA RAV4 PRIME\n\nToyota is rolling out a plug-in electric version of the popular RAV4 small SUV\nthat’s more efficient and faster than the current versions.\n\nThe 2021 RAV4 Prime will be able to go 39 miles (63 kilometers) on battery\npower alone before the gas-electric hybrid propulsion system kicks in. It will\nget the equivalent of 90 miles per gallon (38 kilometers per liter) of\ngasoline, according to Toyota. Yet the 302-horsepower system will take the car\nfrom zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in 5.8 seconds — a full two seconds faster than\nthe current RAV4 Hybrid. The SUV, which is the top-selling vehicle in the U.S.\nthat isn’t a pickup truck, has a tuned-up version of the RAV4 Hybrid’s 176 hp\n2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine powering the front wheels. A separate rear-\nmounted electric motor powers the rear wheels when needed. Toyota says the\nbattery is mounted under the floor, giving the SUV a lower center of gravity\nand improving its handling. The RAV4 Prime goes on sale in the summer. The\nprice wasn’t announced.\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 1\n\n#####  Longtime CT gunmaker leaving state for Wyoming\n\n  * 2\n\n#####  Shelton teacher realizes dream on Wheel of Fortune\n\n  * 3\n\n#####  Police call disappearance of bar owner ‘suspicious’\n\n  * 4\n\n#####  Fairfield dumping documents unsealed\n\n  * 5\n\n#####  3 busted after CT raid finds fentanyl-laced heroin\n\n  * 6\n\n#####  Brickyard Pub owner charged with selling cocaine at Fairfield\nrestaurant\n\n  * 7\n\n#####  Police: Gift card scam costs Derby woman nearly $10K\n\n> Connecticut Post\n\nView Comments\n\n© 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc.\n\nLogo Return to Top\n\n### About\n\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Interest Based Ads\n  * Your California Privacy Rights\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Careers\n  * Advertising\n  * Archives\n\n### Contact\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * FAQ\n  * Today's eEdition\n  * Submissions\n\n### Connect\n\n  * Newsletter Sign-Up\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\nHearst Newspapers © Copyright  Hearst Media Services Connecticut, LLC\n\n"

He also agreed to return the\ncash he received from the use of “We.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\n\nWeWork agreed to a rescue by its largest shareholder, Japanese technology\ninvestment company SoftBank Group Corp, last month as it faced a cash crunch.\nSoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to\nfund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for\nsome of Neumann’s shares.\n\nWeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later\nthis week in areas that do not support WeWork’s core business goals, said The\nWe Company’s recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to\nstaff that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe _New York Times_ reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000\njobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others\nwho work for affiliates.\n\nNext steps to shape the company’s future will be divulged in an all-company\nmeeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\n\nHe said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization\nto grow. “We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and\nresponsibilities,” added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\n\nAn October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would\nbe cut, along with jobs in WeWork’s venture capital arm and in so-called\ngrowth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction\nunits.\n\nThis is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG. The\ncompany rolled back its policy of requiring employees to sign noncompete\nagreements after reaching a settlement with the attorney general last year.\n\nBloomberg News reported on Friday that WeWork is facing scrutiny from the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission over whether it violated financial rules as\nit sought its public listing. WeWork declined to comment on the report.\n\nWeWork’s 2025 bond has weakened sharply in the past week, hitting 16.057% on\nMonday, according to data from MarketAxess.\n\n( _Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, Joshua Franklin, Koh Gui Qing, with\nreporting by Herb Lash and Megan Davies, editing by Martin Howell._ )\n\n## Most Read\n\n  * Brookings: AI will heavily affect tech and white-collar jobs \n  * Hearthstone: Battlegrounds gets four new heroes in big update \n  * Why 'The Mandalorian' cites Fortnite dev Epic Games in its credits \n  * Qualcomm: 5G will cover major metros in 2020, developing countries in 2021 \n  * Clumio raises $135 million for cloud data backup and recovery tools \n\n##  UPCOMING EVENTS\n\n  * GamesBeat Summit Apr. 28-29\n  * Transform Jul. 15-16\n\n"

SPACE VIZZION is a weird EV sports wagon with a secret message\n\nChris Davies \\- Nov 19, 2019, 10:31 pm CST\n\n0\n\nVolkswagen’s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn’t\nexpected until next year, but the automaker isn ‘t slowing down on stacking up\nnew potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the\nmodular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the\nmost striking yet.\n\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a\nwell-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID.\nSPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it’s weighing a potential\nproduction version for North America and Europe.\n\nThe MEB’s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker\nwith the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show\nthis week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is – at 195-inches – about as long as a VW\nAtlas Cross Sport SUV. However it’s narrower and lower.\n\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh\nlithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it’s enough to give\nthe ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There’s electronic\ndamping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\n\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to\nthe front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and\n517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph\ncould arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited\n109 mph.\n\nAs for range, in RWD form you’re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP\ncycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on\nthe EPA cycle.\n\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW’s engineers used some clever\nairflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being\nguided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of\nthe car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\n\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing\nwind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up;\ntouch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical\nlighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined\nby an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime\nrunning lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\n\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing\nthem flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption.\nThe roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear.\nThat’s also where you’ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip\ncrossing the white VW logo.\n\nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the\nID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes\nheadlamps that look like they’re eyes opening.\n\nInside, there’s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench\ninstead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there’s\nAppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice\nproduction. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done\naway with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker\nsays it’ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of\nthe material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\n\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the\ndriver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment,\nand other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can\nbe assigned to different touch-surface controls. There’s a large, fold-out\ncenter console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW’s 20.7 cubic foot trunk\nhas two electric longboards underneath.\n\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch\npanels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery\nmode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation\nand other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively\nchange to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural\nlanguage voice control is supported, too.\n\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a\nluxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes\nto put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market\nsometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the\nability of that to support more niche models in a way that’s still cost\neffective.\n\n## Story Timeline\n\n  * 2020 VW ID.3 official as Volkswagen bets on electric\n  * As VW ID.3 production begins, Volkswagen bets it all on an electric future\n\n###### __VW ID.

(Photo Credit : PTI File Photo )\n\nIn case you are living in Delhi-NCR, chances are you have an app or two to\nfind out the latest air quality index in your area. Since Diwali, despite the\nSupreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the\nmonitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become\na standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower\nsurface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the\nNational Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social\nmedia about an ‘oxygen bar’!\n\nYup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to Condé Nast\nTraveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about\nthis unique ‘bar’. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone\nwho is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we\nhave an oxygen bar in Delhi?\n\nThe answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and\nlanded up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhi’s Saket area that offers\nthis unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is\n‘Oxy Pure’. “An Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched\nwith an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air\npollutants in a cost-effective manner,” the description on the website reads.\n\nOffering ‘rejuvenating’ experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, “consists\nof an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating\ncustomers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula\nalong with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you\nwith more vigour and energy.”\n\nThe brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and\nMargarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas\nand decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299\nfor fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\n\nSo now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to\nvisit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right\nnow is 218, which is in ‘poor’ category.\n\nFirst Published: Tuesday, November 19, 2019 08:38 AM\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n* * *\n\n#### Related Tags:\n\n  * Delhi Pollution \n  * Delhi Smog \n  * Oxygen \n  * Saket \n  * Air Quality \n\n0 Post Comment (+)\n\nLIVE TV VIdeos Photos\n\n### Photo Gallery\n\n  * __\n\n## Happy Birthday Rajkumar Hirani: 5 Movies Of The Director That You Can Watch\nOn Loop\n\n  * __\n\n## International Men’s Day: Most Handsome Classic Actors That Even Put John\nLegend To Shame\n\n  *   * __\n\n## Happy Birthday Sushmita Sen: These Pictures Of Former Miss Universe With\nRohman Shawl Are Just Unmissable!\n\n  * __\n\n## Farhan Akhtar's Girlfriend Shibani Dandekar Sets Internet On Fire With\nSuper-Sexy Pictures\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Career\n  * Advertise With Us\n  * Complaint Redressal\n  * Contact Us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sitemap\n  * RSS\n\n© 2019 News Nation.

Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also\nreceived a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason\nRudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\n\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight\non Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his\nrole in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before\nGarrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\n\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and\nthen claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting\nhimself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off,\nhe's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine\nRudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he\ndeserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately\nfollowing the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph\ninstigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two\nwere on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before\nGarrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet.\nRudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after\nGarrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to\nrunning back Trey Edmunds.\n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain\nCam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday\nnight, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to\nsuspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more\nfocused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game\nwinning streak come to an end.\n\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko\nof the _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of\nthings, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much.\nThat's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to\nlearn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as\nthe NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25\nkickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to\nfacing the Browns again.\n\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I\ndon't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot\n[again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at\nhome, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got\nto put in the work.

Disney’s $6.99-a-month service is\nstocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, “Star Wars,” Marvel\nStudios and classic Disney fare, including “Mary Poppins” and “Bambi.”\n\nThere were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had\nforgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day\nreported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others reported being\nabruptly logged off the service.\n\n“We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn’t make\nme feel good,” Mayer, Disney’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and\ninternational, said Tuesday at the Vox Media’s Code Media conference in\nHollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney’s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and “patched” the\nsoftware as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout\nthe week.\n\nKevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming\nservice\n\n(Walt Disney Co.)\n\nAn undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial,\nalthough it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer\nhinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\n“We’ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see ” Mayer\nsaid.\n\nThe streaming service represents a shift in Disney’s business strategy and,\npotentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered its\nbusiness. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney’s flagship\nESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services,\nsuch as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3\nbillion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take\non Netflix at its own game.\n\nNetflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the\nso-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\n“We will see the industry shake out a bit,” Mayer said. “Not everyone will\nsucceed.”\n\nWall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best\npositioned for success, and how many streaming services consumers will sign up\nfor. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he\nthinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether\nsubscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\n\nHe declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to\nstream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+\napp. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast\nnetworks and the cable channel ESPN.\n\nEventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its\nsports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that\nwould probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\n“There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,” Mayer said.\n“We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.”\n\nGetting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer’s mettle. He is viewed as a\npotential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the\ndesign and last week’s rollout of the service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayer was named chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international\ndivision in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and\ncorporate strategy executive at the company.\n\nHe led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and\nBamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological\nbackbone of Disney’s streaming efforts.\n\nIt’s the first time in Mayer’s career with Disney that he has been in a hands-\non operational role.\n\n“Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,” Mayer said. “ I love what\nI’m doing.”  \n\n* * *\n\nCompany TownTelevisionBusinessEntertainment & Arts\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet our daily Entertainment newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\nMeg James\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * twitter\n  * instagram\n  * email\n  * facebook\n\nMeg James is a corporate media reporter for the Los Angeles Times, covering\nthe business of television and digital disruption in the entertainment\nindustry.

(Manu Fernandez/AP)\n\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nAssociated Press November 19, 2019, 9:02 AM\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nMADRID — Rafael Nadal kept Spain’s hopes alive, then Marcel Granollers and\nFeliciano Lopez completed the comeback in the decisive doubles match to give\nthe hosts a 2-1 win over Russia in the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.\n\nGranollers and Lopez defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev 6-4, 7-6 (5)\nto seal the victory for Spain in a marathon series that ended close to 2 a.m.\nlocal time (0100 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nThe top-ranked Nadal earlier defeated Khachanov 6-3, 7-6 (7) to level the\nseries 1-1 after Rublev had rallied to beat Roberto Bautista-Agut 3-6, 6-3,\n7-6 (0) in the first match.\n\n\"It was a difficult situation for us,\" Lopez said. \"We needed this win,\notherwise we could be close to being out of the tournament. Now we are in a\ngood position to advance.\"\n\nAlthough only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight\nhours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court.\nSpain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia.\nRussia beat Croatia on Monday.\n\nIn the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two\nsingles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the\nknockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six\ngroups.\n\n\"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a\nposition that you don’t want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match,\nwe were under pressure.\"\n\nSerbia’s Novak Djokovic and Britain’s Andy Murray will make their first\nappearance on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays the\nNetherlands.\n\nThe Davis Cup Finals is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams\nplaying in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year\npartnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group\nco-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique.\n\nBrazil star Neymar was among the more than 12,000 in attendance, which also\nincluded a marching band organized by Spanish fans that fired up the crowd\nthroughout the matches.\n\nUS FALLS\n\nThe United States lost to Canada for the first time in the Davis Cup after\nVasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov\ndefeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\n\"Came down to a few points,\" Opelka said. \"Thought I did my part, played well,\nserved well, and I put myself in a position to win. He was just too good.\"\n\nThe U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American\nneighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\n\nFRANCE WINS\n\nTwo days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo\nPierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\n\nHerbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of\nJapan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-\nranked France a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but\ncapitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year’s Davis\nCup runner-up.\n\nThe teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1\nand Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\n\nHerbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals,\nwhere they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New\nZealand in the final on Sunday.\n\n\"We know we’ve arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of\nconfidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win\nbut we’re really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\n\nARGENTINA CRUISES\n\nArgentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating\nNicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2,\n6-2.\n\nThe tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped\nJarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\n\"It’s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for\nsure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I\nthink Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played\nunreal tennis.\"\n\nKAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\n\nKazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and\nclinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\n\nThe Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated\nRobin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van\nde Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\n\"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\n\nAUSTRALIA AHEAD\n\nAustralia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios’ 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro\nGonzalez and Alex de Minaur’s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\n\nColombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\n\nMore from Sportsnet\n\nEpic singles wins give Canada best Davis Cup Finals start imaginable\n\nRyan McKenna\n\nShapovalov, Pospisil give Canada a pair of upsets over Italy at Davis Cup\n\nCanadian Press\n\n%2Ftennis%2Fargentina-comfortably-wins-davis-cup-opener-chile%2F\n\nJoin the Conversation\n\nWhen submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid\nposting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

We moved here two years ago and we’re still in awe of the beauty and\ntake advantage of it every chance we can get. When you think of Colorado you\nprobably think of the mountains, but one thing that most people don’t realize\nis that it’s quite arid. Whether you’re out exploring or just hanging around\nthe house, water is a _must_ here.\n\n### Our hiking survival kit is really very simple.\n\n  * Arrowhead bottled water\n  * baby carrier\n  * healthy snack bars\n  * camera\n\nIn the time we’ve lived here and all of the times we’ve been to Boulder, one\nplace we hadn’t yet visited were the Boulder Flatirons. We always have a baby\ncarrier in the car so for our hike we just had to make a pit stop at Walmart\nfor some easy to carry bottled Arrowhead water and healthy snack bars.\n\nRed was our water boy for this trip. Armed with some ice packs and a portable\ncooler bag, the Arrowhead water stayed nice and cold while being easy for a\nteenager to carry on a mountain hike. We use Arrowhead bottled water because\ntheir bottles are made from BPA-free PET plastic.\n\nReally, have you ever seen anything so gorgeous?\n\nThis guy learned the importance of staying hydrated very early on. Soon after\nwe moved here we went to a festival and he didn’t take our warnings to keep\nhydrated seriously and passed out while waiting in line for a ride. Since that\nday he has never forgotten to make sure he has water at all times when\noutside, especially in the warmer months.\n\nEven Dub had his Arrowhead water in a cup while getting a piggyback ride from\ndaddy. Our baby carrier is another must-have here. Even though he isn’t a baby\nanymore he still loves to ride in his carrier. This allows us to do more\nhiking than we normally would since we don’t have to worry about him being\nable to keep up or getting tired.\n\nWhile we’re at home we still have to stay hydrated and would love to one day\npurchase a water cooler for the BPA-free 5-gallon bottles of Arrowhead water.\nHopefully, Walmart will have these available soon so we don’t have to make\nsure we’re home for a delivery. That would be a huge time saver for us.\n\nBe sure to visit Arrowhead on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\n**What is your favorite weekend family activity?

(NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/David\nLadd)\n\nSPACE\n\n#  NASA Just Confirmed There Are Water Plumes Above The Surface of Jupiter's\nMoon Europa\n\nVICTOR TANGERMANN, FUTURISM\n\n18 NOV 2019\n\nA team led by researchers out of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in\nGreenbelt, Maryland, has confirmed traces of water vapor above the surface of\nJupiter's icy moon Europa.\n\nAnd that's a big deal as the tiny space rock is one of the highest priority\ntargets in NASA's search for extraterrestrial life, according to the agency.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the\nnext best thing: water in vapor form,\" lead researcher and NASA planetary\nscientist Lucas Paganini said in a NASA statement.\n\nAccording to a paper published in the journal _Nature Astronomy_ on Monday,\nthe NASA team discovered enough water vapor being released from Europa to fill\nan Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.\n\nBut while that sounds like a lot, it was only just enough to be detected from\nEarth.\n\nOut of 17 observations by the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which uses a\nspectrograph to detect the chemical compositions of other planets' atmospheres\nby scanning the infrared light they release or absorb, the scientists only\nspotted water vapor in one.\n\n\"We suggest that the outgassing of water vapour on Europa occurs at lower\nlevels than previously estimated, with only rare localized events of stronger\nactivity,\" Paganini and his team wrote in the paper.\n\nFor many years, scientists have suspected that there's water on Europa's\nsurface, and several observations appear to back up that suspicion.\n\nMore than two decades ago, NASA's Galileo spacecraft found evidence of an\nelectrically conductive fluid on the moon's surface. Then, a 2018 analysis of\nthe data found evidence of massive plumes of liquid. Data previously collected\nby NASA's Hubble Space Telescope supported the existence of the plumes.\n\n\"We performed diligent safety checks to remove possible contaminants in\nground-based observations,\" Goddard planetary scientist Avi Mandell said of\nthe water vapor discovery in the statement. \"But, eventually, we'll have to\nget closer to Europa to see what's really going on.\"\n\nA mission to do just that is already lined up.\n\nNASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission will get a much closer look at the icy\nmoon's surface as soon as 2023.\n\nThe spacecraft will feature a suite of cameras, spectrometers, and a radar to\ninvestigate the thickness of Europa's icy shell during 45 flybys — and perhaps\nyield further insights into the water vapor above the moon's surface while\nit's there.\n\n **This article was originally published byFuturism.

It’s part of a larger pollution\nproblem in India. Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nAnother cloud of choking smoke and dust is set to descend upon the 20 million\nresidents of Delhi this week, with forecasters warning that air pollution is\nlikely to reach “severe” or “emergency” levels on Wednesday. The dangerous,\ndirty air is arising from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and\nrural smoke converging over India’s capital region.\n\nIt’s the latest wave of severe air pollution in recent weeks. Delhi’s Chief\nMinister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter last month to describe his city as\na “gas chamber.”\n\n> Delhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in\n> neighbouring states  \n>  \n> It is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt &\n> govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks today  \n>  \n> I urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaq\n>\n> — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) November 1, 2019\n\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public\nhealth emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to\nschoolchildren.\n\nLast week, some air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and\npollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health\nOrganization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes\nin a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor\nand reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a\nrating of “hazardous.”\n\nAir pollution in Delhi remains “unhealthy” this week.  Berkeley Earth\n\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and\nit’s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health\nOrganization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the\nmost pollution from PM2.5 — particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter\nthat can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems — were in\nIndia. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there\nwere 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world.\nIndia suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of\nthese deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies\nof 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\n\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when\npollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for\nyears, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the\ncountry **** and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is\nworsening for Indians.\n\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many\nemerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies\nurbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem\nwith roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to\ndistinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water\nconservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in\nbetter governance.\n\n### Why Delhi’s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\n\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of\nTexas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and\ndilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in\nDelhi, there’s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\n\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up\ntrapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is\nalso landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\n\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi’s\nmore than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles\nrun on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke\nmotors. Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80\npercent of the region’s total pollution. Dust from the city’s construction\nboom is also a contributor to the city’s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid\nfuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation.\n\nThese sources contribute to Delhi’s year-round pollution. But there are\nseveral additional factors making air quality even worse now.\n\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning\nfires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\n\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu\nfestival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off\nfireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October\n27 this year.\n\n> The air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly\n> predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every\n> November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by\n> the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks.\n> pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YN\n>\n> — Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\n\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi’s pollution right now isn’t\ncoming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of\nyear burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and\nrestore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these\nfires has wafted over the city in recent days.\n\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of\nresidents. “It’s like you’re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink\nthat’s plugged up,” Apte said. “It overflows with spectacular consequences.”\n\n### Delhi’s air wasn’t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the\nrise in pollution.\n\n“I’m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never\nexperienced this pollution,” said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the\nCenter for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. “The\n[severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened\nin 2009?”\n\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India’s\nbreadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this\nregion helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\n\nBurning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and\nharming air quality.  Sakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage\nas farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To\ncombat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of\nSubsoil Water Act.\n\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice\nproduction typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first\ncultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act\nprohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The\ndelay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\n\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab’s water\ntable. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October\nrice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter\nwheat, which is typically sown mid-November.\n\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can’t hire a large\nnumber of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields\nof the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and\nquickest method to prepare for the next planting — burning crop stubble.\n\nThis satellite image from NASA’s worldview satellite shows fires detected\n(red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019.  NASA Worldview\n\nOf course, it’s not just rural pollution that’s choking Delhi. The urban\nsources of pollution — traffic, construction, cooking fires — have also\nincreased as the region’s population has boomed by more than 7 million people\nin the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\n\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air\nquality in Delhi in recent years.\n\n### Delhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are\nreluctant to take aggressive action\n\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting\n210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops\nand explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\n\nBrick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials\nalso implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of\nthe cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers.\nRoughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules.\nHowever, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.\n\nIndia’s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop\nburning. Yet fires have continued, showing that enforcement is a problem, and\nfarmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.\n\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air\nquality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it’s\nbecause of shifts in the weather — not policy.\n\n“This is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to\nsouth-easterly, which allowed Delhi’s air to slightly improve,” Kurinji\nSelvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment\nand Water think tank told CBS News.\n\nOfficials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to\nschoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution.  Sonu Mehta/Hindustan\nTimes/Getty Images\n\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the\nsources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. “Part of\nthe challenge is that there’s a character of ‘Oh no, you first,’ ‘No, you\nfirst,’” Apte said. “No one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would\nlead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily\nsharing equal portions of the blame.”\n\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also\na political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers,\nconstruction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have\na seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid\nthe pollution — many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious\nminority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old\nsectarian wounds.\n\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India’s last\nelection cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to\nstop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning,\ndriving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\n“People will be up in revolt, they’ll stop trains, there will be riots, and\nnobody wants to get into this hassle,” Prakash said. “It’s actually a very,\nvery noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto\npoints.”\n\n### Air pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\n\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has\nbeen fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air\nquality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from\ndangerous smog.\n\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County\nregularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the\ncountry as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air\npollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\n\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many\nhave made important progress in consistently improving air quality by\nenforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology.\nThe persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of\neconomic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\n\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist\nSimon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is\nimpoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but\nbeyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as\npollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are\nimplemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an\nagrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is\ngetting the worst of both worlds.\n\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops,\npollution gets worse before it gets better. Ecological Economics\n\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash\nsaid. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their\nair quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that\nChina’s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian\ngovernment, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories\nand limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it\ngets done. The government has since drastically reduced the amount of\nindustrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\n“The beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do\nit,” Prakash said. “Nothing stands between the decision and the\nimplementation.”\n\nThat’s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To\nclear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies\nand incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics,\nhelping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their\nharvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\n\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward\ncharity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers\nand reduce pollution.\n\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner\nenergy. “If one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to\npollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,” Prakash said. It’s\nnot just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and\ntrucks.\n\nHeavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in\nDelhi. Biplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable\nenergy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action\nSummit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would\nmore than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to\n450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in\nfossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for\neconomic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to\naccept the tradeoffs.\n\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used,\na region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make\na difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money,\nand foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing\nmetropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos,\nNigeria. “The problem can be solved,” Prakash said. “But what you need is\npolitical will and a bit of imagination.”\n\n##  Next Up In Science & Health\n\n  * A clever new solar solution to one of the trickiest climate problems\n  * How Apollo moon rocks reveal the epic history of the cosmos\n  * These senators are going after the biggest climate villains in Washington\n  * Brazil’s Amazon rainforest destruction is at its highest rate in more than a decade \n  * Trump’s controversial vaping flavor ban is now dead\n  * With impeachment, America’s epistemic crisis has arrived\n\n###  Most Read\n\n  1.

According to Reuters, the NYAG’s questions include if WeWork founder\nand former CEO Adam Neumann engaged in self-dealing.\n\nWeWork is headquartered in New York City. A company spokesperson said in an\nemail that “we have received an inquiry from the office of the New York State\nAttorney General and are cooperating in the matter.” The New York State\nAttorney General’s office had no comment.\n\nThis comes less than a week after Bloomberg reported WeWork is the subject of\na U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into potential rule\nviolations related to its cancelled IPO.\n\nWeWork’s parent company, The We Company,  announced on Sept. 30 that it was\nwithdrawing its S-1 filing for an initial public offering, shortly after\nNeumann stepped down as CEO. In addition to questions about the company’s\nfinancial state, red flags for investors included that Neumann had borrowed\nagainst his WeWork shares and leased properties he owned back to the company.\n\nAn entity Neumann controlled also sold the company the right to use the word\n“We” for $5.9 million, though he later asked the company to unwind the\nagreement and returned the money after public criticism.\n\nAfter receiving a lifeline from investor SoftBank  worth up to $8 billion,\nWeWork is now engaging in major cost-cutting measures, including layoffs at\nMeetup, which it acquired for $200 million in 2017.\n\n"

The main reason for the actual failure of the U.N. Plan is the failure\nof American side to fulfill its obligations. Despite numerous U.S. promises to\ninfluence the illegal armed groups under their control, the militants\nsabotaged early notifications of the planned action, limited the duration of\nthe humanitarian convoy’s stay, engaged in extortion, and directly threatened\nfamilies wishing to leave the camp.”\n\nSource: Russian Defense Ministry, October 25, 2019\n\nFalse\n\nInformation from multiple sources disputes the claims\n\nIn a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense\nministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria’s al-Tanf of controlling\n“bandit formations” and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in\nthe Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian\ngovernment.\n\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as “patently false,” and both\nindependent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the\nRussian and Syrian claims are false.\n\n**The al-Tanf base**\n\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave\nSyria under President Donald Trump’s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S.\nmilitary personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East\nobservers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq\nand Syria.\n\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer “de-confliction zone” on the\nBaghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as\nan outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in\norder to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces.\nThe U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation\ncampaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\n\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\n\n#### **The Rukban camp**\n\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syria’s\nborder with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the\ncountry’s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross\nover to Jordan.\n\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted\nmore than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan’s economy and\ninfrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban\ncrossing point.\n\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at\naround 40,000.\n\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian\ndisaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to\nforce the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\n####  **“U.S.-controlled bandit formations”**\n\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian\nopposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT – formerly the Free\nSyrian Army – to fight against Islamic State.\n\nOmar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based\ngeopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018\nthat MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the\nforefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that\nthe U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as\n\"certainly absurd.\"\n\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at\nTufts University’s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the\nRussian Defense Ministry’s allegations are false.\n\n“I can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not ‘control’ any\nactors there directly,” Simpson said. “From my interviews, it appears all U.S.\ninterventions in the region are indirect and sparse.”\n\n**“… prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp”**\n\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban\ncamp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be\nidentified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry’s claim is\n“absolutely not true.”\n\n“Not the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing\ncivilians from leaving the camp,” the source said. “Many people are afraid to\nreturn to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They\nwant a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.”\n\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military\noperation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon\ncorrespondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense\nministry’s claim “is patently false,” and that “the United States is not\npreventing people from leaving Rukban.”\n\n“Rukban is another example of the Assad regime’s consistent practice, with\nRussian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using\nthe situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane\nbehavior,” Robertson said.\n\nHe added: “The (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of\nstarvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are\nblocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take\nresponsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must\ncontinue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.”\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is\n“working in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said\nthey need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary\nguarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure\nU.N. access to the shelters in Homs.”\n\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to\nleave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\n\n“Although Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into\nJordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border\nsecurity operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to\ncivilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the\nregion,” Simpson said. “This is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban,\nrather than returning to say, Palmyra.”\n\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: “The United States does not support\nforced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they\nare hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and\ndignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.”\n\n##  Most popular\n\n  * ###  Most Viewed \n\n    * 1\n\n####  Phone Intercepts Suggest Russian Control Over Ukraine Separatists Ahead\nof Malaysia Airline Shootdown\n\n    * 2\n\n####  Russia and Syria: U.S.-backed Syrian Forces Blocking Refugee Return\n\n    * 3\n\n####  Transnistrian TV Spins Russian Expert’s Statement On Independence\n\n    * 4\n\n####  Hey Daily Mail: It’s 'Ki-yeev,' Not ‘KEEV’\n\n    * 5\n\n####  Russian Official: Extradition of Russian Hacker to U.S. Illegal -- False\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Follow Us \n\n    *     *     *     *   * Info \n\n    * About this project\n    * Terms of Use\n    * Contact Us\n    * Newsletter\n    * Vacancies\n\n© 2019 POLYGRAPH.info All Rights Reserved.\n\nXS\n\nSM\n\nMD\n\nLG\n\n"

The denials were in spite\nof the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City\nmansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for\nsex parties.\n\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is,\nthe general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and\ndisgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but “an articulated\nlorry crash” performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent\nmedia suspicions of culpability in Epstein’s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has\nleft himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and\nevasions.\n\n> “Prince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his\n> position as a member of the royal family,” said one legal expert, as\n> reported by the Independent newspaper.\n\n> “His friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under\n> investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,” the expert\n> warned.\n\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and\ncontradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of\nalleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein’s “unbecoming” behavior (classic\naloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an\nalibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18\nyears ago – on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a\nhouse in London belonging to Epstein’s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A\nphoto of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\n\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited\nEpstein in New York in 2010 – after Epstein was released from prison for\ntrafficking a minor for prostitution – in order to terminate his friendship.\n\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in\nperson that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of\nfriendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein’s orgy\nmansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\n\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with\nEpstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how\nvulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\n\n> He instead told the BBC interviewer: “I took the judgement call that because\n> this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over\n> the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and\n> talk to him.”\n\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The\nrectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all\nthis purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein\ncontradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were “not close”.\n\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations\npunctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew’s otherwise “lack of remorse”\nor “sympathy” with the victims of Epstein’s sex abuse empire, as expressed in\nthe BBC interview.\n\nLawyers for Epstein’s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview\ngiven by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by\nprosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-\nindictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for\nquestioning.\n\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice\nfrom several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated\nmedia fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen\nElizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\n\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work,\npublicly-funded royals are.\n\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands\nWar (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience\nallegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body\nsweating.\n\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Let’s see if he\ncan keep his royal pants dry this time.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect\nthose of Sputnik.\n\n...\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle+\n\nBlogger\n\nPinterest\n\nStumbleUpon\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n553\n\nTrackDo not trackCommunity standardsDiscussion\n\nComment via FacebookComment via Sputnik\n\n  *  __Сomment\n  *  __Add Comment\n\nThank you!

Jangan\ncuma di kerongkongan.  \nJangan lebay dalam mencintai atau membenci sesuatu. Biasa biasa saja. Jangan\nsampai karena kita amat membenci satu kaum, akhirnya kita justru menganiaya\nmereka secara keji / biadab:\n\n> **“…Dan janganlah sekali-kali kebencian(mu) kepada sesuatu kaum karena\n> mereka menghalang-halangi kamu dari Masjidilharam, mendorongmu berbuat\n> aniaya (kepada mereka)…” [Al Maa-idah 2]**\n>\n> **“… Dan janganlah sekali-kali kebencianmu terhadap sesuatu kaum, mendorong\n> kamu untuk berlaku tidak adil. Berlaku adillah, karena adil itu lebih dekat\n> kepada takwa…” [Al Maa-idah 8]**\n\nKita harus hati2 terhadap aliran ekstrim “Penegak Sunnah” yang menanamkan\nkebencian yang amat sangat pada satu kaum sehingga akhirnya membantai kaum tsb\ndgn berbagai bom bunuh diri. Nabi dan para sahabat meng-Islam-kan Orang Kafir\ntanpa paksaan. Laa ikroha fid diin. Bukan membantai orang kafir.\n\nDari hadits Abu Hurairah ra, Rasulullah SAW bersabda :\n\nْﺐِﺒْﺣَﺃ َﻚَﺒﻴِﺒَﺣ ﺎًﻧْﻮَﻫ ﺎَﻣ ﻰَﺴَﻋ ْﻥَﺃ َﻥﻮُﻜَﻳ َﻚَﻀْﻴِﻐَﺑ ﺎًﻣْﻮَﻳ ،ﺎَﻣ  \nْﺾِﻐْﺑَﺃَﻭ َﻚَﻀْﻴِﻐَﺑ ﺎًﻧْﻮَﻫ ﺎَﻣ ﻰَﺴَﻋ ْﻥَﺃ َﻥﻮُﻜَﻳ َﻚَﺒﻴِﺒَﺣ ﺎًﻣْﻮَﻳ  \nﺎَﻣ\n\n“Cintailah orang yang kamu cintai sekadarnya. Bisa jadi orang yang sekarang\nkamu cintai suatu hari nanti harus kamu benci. Dan bencilah orang yang kamu\nbenci sekadarnya, bisa jadi di satu hari nanti dia menjadi orang yang harus\nkamu cintai.”\n\n[HR. At-Tirmidzi no.1997 dan dishahihkan Asy-Syaikh Al-Albani  \ndalam Shahih Al-Jami’ no. 178]\n\nUmar bin Al-Khaththab ra berkata, “Wahai Aslam, janganlah rasa cintamu\nberlebihan dan jangan sampai kebencianmu membinasakan.” Aslam berkata,\n“Bagaimana itu?” Umar radiallohu anhu berkata, “Jika engkau mencintai\nseseorang, janganlah berlebihan seperti halnya anak kecil yang menyenangi\nsesuatu dengan berlebihan. Jika engkau membenci seseorang, jangan sampai\nkebencian menimbulkan keinginan orang yang kamu  \nbenci celaka atau binasanya.”\n\nAl-Hasan Al-Bashri ra berkata, “Hendaknya kalian mencintai jangan berlebihan\ndan membenci tidak berlebihan. Telah ada orang-orang yang berlebihan dalam\nmencintai satu kaum akhirnya binasa. Ada pula yang berlebihan dalam membenci\nsatu kaum dan mereka pun binasa.”\n\n[Ni’matul Ukhuwah hal. 41]\n\nIklan\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Cetak\n  * Surat elektronik\n  * Lagi\n  * \n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Tumblr\n  *   * Reddit\n  * Pinterest\n  *   * \n\n### Sukai ini:\n\nSuka Memuat...\n\n### _Terkait_\n\nFiled under: Khawarij |\n\n« Najd (Arab Saudi) Serang Yaman dan Syam Location of Najd is in Iraq or in\nNajd? »\n\n### Satu Tanggapan\n\n  1. **Pembuat Film Fitna Dirikan Partai Islam Di Eropa | Berita Islami** , on Desember 30, 2015 at 4:36 am said: \n\n[…] https://kabarislamia.com/2015/03/30/jangan-membenci-satu-kaum-secara-\nberlebihan/ […]\n\nBalas\n\n### Tinggalkan Balasan Batalkan balasan\n\nKetikkan komentar di sini...\n\nPlease log in using one of these methods to post your comment:\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nSurel (wajib) (Alamat takkan pernah dipublikasikan)\n\nNama (wajib)\n\nSitus Web\n\n****You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

A preview of the report was shared with paying subscribers.  \n  \n_16-inch MacBook Pro's new scissor switch keyboard viaiFixit_  \nThe report claims the display size will remain 13.3 inches, although given the\nsource is _DigiTimes_ , we would not completely rule out hopes of a larger\n14-inch display. Wistron and Global Lighting Technologies are said to be among\nthe suppliers of the keyboards for the smaller notebook.  \n  \nThe new 16-inch MacBook Pro features a redesigned scissor switch keyboard,\nlargely based on the standalone Magic Keyboard for the iMac. Given the tried-\nand-tested design, the keyboard should prove far more reliable than the\ntroublesome butterfly keyboards used across the MacBook lineup in recent\nyears.  \n  \nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro also features a physical Esc key and an inverted-T\narrow key layout. It is unclear if the 13-inch MacBook Pro will follow suit.  \n  \nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously predicted that Apple will transition\nits entire notebook lineup to scissor switch keyboards in 2020, including all\nMacBook Pro and MacBook Air models.  \n  \nIt would be hardly surprising if Apple completely moves past its butterfly\nkeyboards, which have suffered from issues with sticky, repeating, or\nnonfunctional keys since their inception in 2016. Apple continues to offer\nfree repairs to affected customers as part of its worldwide service program.  \n  \nThe entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro was last updated in July, while higher-end\n13-inch models were refreshed in May.  \n  \n\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Pro\n\nTag: digitimes.com\n\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\n\n[ 167 comments ]\n\n  *   * \n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\n(View all)\n\nWoyzeck\n\n2 days ago at 07:52 am\n\nIt‘s good to see Apple un-iveing its products.\n\n**Rating:** 36 Votes\n\nNick A\n\n2 days ago at 07:47 am\n\nI think we'll see similar updates to what the 16\" received. The bezels on the\n13\" are large, and a 14\" display makes sense along with the magic keyboard,\nimproved speakers and mics, and updated thermal design.  \n  \nEven if it increases the weight/thickness slightly, this is a \"Pro\" machine\nand I like the direction Apple is taking in that regard.\n\n**Rating:** 25 Votes\n\nfmcshan\n\n2 days ago at 07:50 am\n\nIt would be nice if Apple switched to a 14” MacBook Pro with slimmer bezels\njust like they did with the 16” model.\n\n**Rating:** 17 Votes\n\ntjedora\n\n2 days ago at 07:51 am\n\nShouldn't 2020 be the year of a \"complete\" redesign?\n\n**Rating:** 12 Votes\n\nmike...\n\n2 days ago at 08:12 am\n\n  \nNo surprise Apple is keeping the 13\". Kuo's also predicting the return of 15\"\nwith scissor.  \n  \nIt makes the MacBook Pro lineup more complete.  \n\n  \n14\" and 16\" make more sense.  \n  \n14\", 15.4\", and 16\" makes no sense.\n\n**Rating:** 10 Votes\n\nNick A\n\n2 days ago at 07:54 am\n\n  \nShouldn't 2020 be the year of a \"complete\" redesign?  \n\n  \nI think this is it. The slimmer bezels, updated thermal design, and magic\nkeyboard are the redesign, they just started it with the 16\". I think this is\nthe design we've got until they move to mini-LED and ARM.  \n  \nEdit: I'm going to predict that a FaceID sensor with a upgraded camera is\nlikely to come before the next redesign, but it's probably not going to be\nanytime soon or else we would have seen it in the 16\".\n\n**Rating:** 9 Votes\n\nPickUrPoison\n\n2 days ago at 08:49 am\n\n  \nIf we’re going to have the privelidge of getting a high quality brand new\nscissor switch mechanism, that no other laptop in the mark has, this better\nstart at $2000 and no less. We don’t want cheap plastic laptops!!  \n\nDidn’t we just go through this with the 16”—with the Apple-hate crowd\npredicting $3,500, $4,000 and even $5,000? Turns out we got a bigger screen\nAND a price cut.  \n  \nThere’s no reason to think a 13” with the new keyboard, whether it keeps the\n13” display or moves up to 14”, will be any higher than the current\n$1,299/$1,799.\n\n**Rating:** 9 Votes\n\nfalkon-engine\n\n2 days ago at 07:54 am\n\nIf they offer the new keyboard on a new 14 inch form factor, better radeon\nNavi graphics, and Wifi6, plus 32 GB of RAM, I might sign up.....\n\n**Rating:** 7 Votes\n\nZdigital2015\n\n2 days ago at 08:51 am\n\n  \nI agree but it begs the question...who the heck was/is in charge of the\ncompany...Ive or Cook?  \n\n  \nBefore he died, Steve Jobs gave Jony Ive a tremendous amount of veto power\ninside of Apple (Chief Design Officer) that I suspect has lead to an internal\npower struggle between the two and behind closed doors the MacBook Pro\nkeyboard issues and Ive not keen to create yet another tower Mac pushed things\nto the breaking point. There is a correlation between the perceived decline in\nApple’s focus on Macs and consumer’s needs, wants and desires, with the design\ndirection that was taken in the 2016-2019 MacBook Pro, the lack of substantive\nupdates to the Mac mini and the 2013 MacPro, as well as the hoopla over Jony\nIve’s outside projects and dare I say it, weight gain, that leads me to\nbelieve that he was Ready to leave Apple back in 2015 after the Watch was\nreleased or even earlier and maybe he is or was suffering from some form of\ndepression.  \n  \nAgain, this is conjecture on my part, I have no insider knowledge and only a\nfew links to back up my assertions. But I’ve seen and lived parts of this\nbefore in my professional life. I suspect Ive was incredibly frustrated with\nCook’s focus on costs, margin, supply chain, moving away from computers\n(although I think Ive was with him on that) and Cook’s relative lack of Deep\ncaring or interest in the process of design, aesthetics, elegance...and that\nlead to a fractious working relationship. Steve balanced them out, acted as a\nbuffer and took on the responsibility of making the final decisions, although\nI think he favored Ive’s arguments more times than anyone would admit. So to\nkeep Cook, Jobs made him CEO and to balance it out, elevated Ive to CDO and\ngave him almost co-equal CEO power.  \n  \nThese sorts or working relationships are fragile, egocentric, mercurial and\nnot prone to longevity. Ive no longer wants to be held back and these external\nprojects were to try and give him a chance to spread his wings while retaining\nhim as long as possible. The past 4-8 years are a result of this, I believe,\nwe just have no transparency into any of Apple’s corporate drama.  \n  \nAgain, my opinion, my conjecture, my experiences. Thanks for letting me ramble\non.  \n[automerge]1574096160[/automerge]  \n\n  \nI sure wish Apple would offer the opportunity to upgrade the keyboards from\nthe 2018 models to the new keyboard. I be happy to pay for the privilege. I\nhad a chance to play with the new one this weekend, and it's much better\nfeeling than the pounding-on-concrete version I have.  \n\n  \nDifferent chassis with different engineering, and that extra thickness is part\nof what is necessary to embed the scissors into the new 16”. Long story,\nshort, a retrofit is not possible.  \n  \nBest situation is to sell your 15” and buy the 16” and stop pounding on\nconcrete. Just my 2¢.\n\n**Rating:** 7 Votes\n\nascender\n\n2 days ago at 08:58 am\n\n  \nShouldn't 2020 be the year of a \"complete\" redesign?  \n\n  \nI think the new 16\" machine _is_ the re-design - upgraded internals for\nimproved thermal performance; new keyboard; speakers; mics; larger screen.  \n  \nThey've pretty much nailed the form factor of what we consider a laptop to be.\n\n**Rating:** 6 Votes\n\n  \n[ Read All Comments ]\n\n### Guides\n\n  * Night Mode (iPhone 11)\n\nNight mode is an automatic setting which takes advantage of the new wide-angle\ncamera that's in the ‌iPhone 11‌ and 11 Pro models.

Skimming device found at Eagan Kwik Trip \n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. — Hours before Zach Parise’s two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild\ncoach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he\nalways finds a way to start scoring.\n\n“It takes a little longer now, but he’s playing well now, he’s getting a\nlittle bit of confidence back,” Boudreau said before the Wild’s 4-1 win over\nthe Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. “That goes a long way.”\n\nRight now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is\nbrimming with confidence.\n\nParise’s first-period goals – he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56\n– gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn’t relinquish.\n\nFor good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third\nperiod.\n\n“That’s perfect,” Boudreau said. “It’s the mark of a true competitor doing\nthings for the team.”\n\nBarely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild\ndefenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise’s penchant for changing sticks,\ncould see the frustration on his friend’s face.\n\n“He’s used to scoring goals, getting points,” he said.\n\nBut Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just\nthree four times in his first 18 games.\n\n“You can go either way,” Parise said. “I was going the other way for a little\nwhile. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.”\n\nParise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the\nneutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek’s feed on a two-on-one.\n\nHe tipped Suter’s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres.\n\n“He’s starting to feel it a little bit again,” Boudreau said. “And we need\nthose goals.”\n\nThe Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been\non his players to avoid looking at the standings.\n\n“It’s hard not to, though,” Suter acknowledged. “We know where we are, we know\nwhat we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step\nforward.”\n\nBoudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to “believe in\nyourselves” and that the Wild are a “good team.”\n\n“You’ve beaten some really good teams this year,” he said he said he told\nthem. “You’ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start\nbelieving in yourself, then good things are going to happen.\n\n“I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because\nI knew they were a good team but they just weren’t playing good.”\n\nThe Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching\nstart, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In\nthe second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw\npunches, although neither player received a fighting major.\n\n“I didn’t really see him coming,” Eriksson Ek said. “He came off my back and,\nlike, I just wasn’t ready for it.”\n\nParise said: “We’ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under\ntheir skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.”\n\nEichel said he was “just trying to spark some energy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan\nDubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots.\nSabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third\nperiod.\n\nDefenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason\nZucker’s empty-net goal sealed it.\n\nThe Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an\nundisclosed injury.\n\n“I haven’t talked to the trainers at all,” Boudreau said.\n\n  * Tags: \n  * Minnesota Wild\n\n###  Bill Hoppe\n\nAs you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.\nOur goal with article comments is to provide a space for civil, informative\nand constructive conversations.

Follow us at Twitter@igndeals._We bring you the best\ndeals we've found today on video games, hardware, electronics, and a bunch of\nrandom stuff too. Updated 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Black Friday is\napproaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black\nFriday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday\nadscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\n\n## PS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\n\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to\nBlack Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the\nDualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its\ncolor and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to\nlook grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for 39.99\n\n## Nintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\n\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword\nor Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition.\nWe haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and\nthis bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even\non Black Friday).  \n\n  * Get it at Walmart for $238.99\n\n## King of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R\nCurved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\n\nThis is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming\nmonitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming\nmonitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include\na 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and\n99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz\nrefresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely\nlove it, both for work and for games.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $649.99\n\n## New Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99\n(Originally $200)\n\nScore the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll\nsave $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most\npeople probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates\ncompared to the Series 3. What everyone **will** appreciate, though, is the\nextra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's\nwaterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small,\nsleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $169.99\n  * Also at Walmart\n\n## New Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139\n(Originally $159)\n\nIt's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very\npopular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped\ntoday to the lowest price we've ever seen.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $139\n  * Also at Walmart\n\n## 45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\n\nOne of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift\ncard, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're\nessentially getting it for $499.  \n\n  * Get it at Dell for $549\n\n## Dell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD\nfor $799.99\n\n**Use code \"50OFF699\"**  \n  \n****This is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX\n1660 Ti is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw\nperformance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of\nmemory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.  \n\n  * **Use code \"50OFF699\"** to get it at Dell for $799.99\n\n## Netgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\n\n**Clip the $10 off coupon on the product page**  \n  \nThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and\nnon-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive\nscore and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk\nX4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters\ncan't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds),\nanything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if\nyou run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $67.77\n\n## Get Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\n\n**_This sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane._**  \n  \nIf you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password)\nfor every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites\nexperiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to\nuncover your login info one day—and if you use the same credentials across\nmultiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your\nsensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by\nrandomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and\nautomatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of\nthe best password managers of 2019. Dashlane offers a free version of its\nsoftware that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill\nfunctionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is\navailable) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web\nMonitoring, and secure VPN.  \n\n  * Download Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n\n## 4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\n\nThis deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but **you\ndon't have to be a Prime member**. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music\nUnlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service\n(or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed,\nbut it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make\nsure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free\nversions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists\nthat you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.  \n\n  * Get 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n\n## $10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\n\nSave a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or\nGray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't\nseen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is\nstill $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.  \n\n  * Get it at Walmart for $249.95\n\n## New Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with\nBonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\n\nAfter a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian\nand Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the\nsame titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are\nnon-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch\nPro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't\nplay in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to\nplay the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.  \n\n  * Get it with Free Case at Walmart for $199.96\n  * Get it by itself on Amazon for $199\n\n## New Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon\nCredit\n\n_\"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its\nmost tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\"_ Read our Pokemon\nSword and Shield review _._  \n  \nIf you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has\nthe best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if\nyou get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but\nwe confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it\nwill end very, very soon so hurry!  \n\n  * Get Pokemon Sword on Amazon for $58.99\n  * Get Pokemon Shield for $58.56\n\n## 70\" Element 4K UHD Smart HDTV with Roku for $499.99 (Originally $800)\n\nI think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday\nseason. This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated\nSmart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for\nextended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart\nby January for whatever reason).  \n\n  * Get it at Walmart for $499.99\n\n## $15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\n\nThe new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and\nthe upgrades are worth getting merry over. These are the first AirPods with\nactive noise cancellation, and despite the technology they still feature up to\n5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include three sets\nof silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell,\nand a wireless charger case that can provide up to 24 hours of battery life.\nIf you're hoping the price will drop on Black Friday... you're fooling\nyourself. Even now, the shipping has been delayed which means these will go\nout of stock very soon.  \n\n  * Get it on Amazon for $234.98\n\n## 30% Off LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series Betrayal at Cloud City\n2,812-Piece Set, Now $243.97\n\nThe 2,812 piece Betrayal at Cloud City reenactment measures 22\" long and 22\"\nwide and is the first in an Expert class of LEGO Star Wars sets called the\n\"Master Builder Series\". The Master Builder Series is similar to the Ultimate\nCollector Series in complexity, scale, and probably resale value. The primary\ndifference is that the Master Builder Series sets emphasizes playability\nwhereas the UCS sets focus on authenticity. This is the biggest discount ever\nfor the Cloud City set, and probably won't last.  \n\n  * ~~Get it on Amazon for $243.97~~\n\n## Disney Plus is Now Live, Sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+ Package\nand Save $5/Month\n\nDisney+ is now live and you can watch a dazzling number of Disney, Pixar,\nMarvel, and Star Wars movies and shows all from a single subscription. This is\nalso currently the only way to watch the new big Star Wars TV series, The\nMandalorian, which airs starting today.  \n  \nIf you just want Disney+, you can sign up for a free 7-day trial. Afterwards\nyou'll pay $6.99 per month. If you know you're in it for the long haul, then\nyou can pay a $69.99 annual subscription fee, which saves you $14.  \n  \nAn even better deal is if you sign up for the Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+\nbundle. In that case you pay only $12.99. If you were to subscribe to all thee\nservices separately, you'd be paying around $17.99 per month, so you'd be\nsaving $60 every year.  \n  \n**Note:** The bundle includes Hulu with limited commercials. If you want ad-\nfree Hulu, you will have to upgrade to it BEFORE signing up for the bundle\nplan. Here's the TL;DR version of signing up for ad-free Hulu as part of the\nDisney+ bundled package:  \n\n  * Sign up for a Hulu ad-free account for $11.99 a month\n  * If you already have a Hulu account, visit your account page to upgrade\n  * Sign up for the Disney+ bundle using the same email as your Hulu account\n\n## ______________________________\n\n_Eric Song is IGN's deal curator and spends 25% of his pay on stuff he posts._\n\nIf you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the sale.

While some people\ncarry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their\npersonal and professional tasks on the same device.\n\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are\nwriting custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\n\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely\nproud of his company's trajectory on that front.\n\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has\nredefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"—and someone he's\nlearned a lot from.\n\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\n\nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the\nDreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote\nwith a couple songs.\n\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he\ndid an internship at the company.\n\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base\nas the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on\nmobile devices.\n\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don’t even own a computer\nanymore and I don’t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good\njob.\"\n\nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\n\nCook said the admiration is mutual.\n\n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly\nincorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told\nBenioff.\n\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba\nBuena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the\nsame stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\n\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script\nin a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\n\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to\nexchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such\na great leader.\n\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he\npassed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\n\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human\nright\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook\nsaid.\n\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally\nrequired to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while\nencouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\n\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for\nDACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to\nreceive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they\ngrew up after entering undocumented.\n\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love\nof their country and commitment to it.\"\n\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook\nsaid, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * Smart Phones\n  * Cloud Software\n  * Enterprise Applications\n\nBack to Top __\n\n## related stories\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\nDrybar’s Rise To Success With NetSuite Has A Hidden Message For Partners\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\n‘Unmistakable Bias’: AWS Challenges Microsoft’s JEDI Cloud Win\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\n10 Emerging Cloud Computing Trends To Watch In 2020\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\n5 Key Announcements At Microsoft Ignite 2019\n\n  * ######  News Cloud \n\nRackspace Acquires Cloud-Native AWS Specialist Onica\n\n## trending stories\n\n  1. ###### Virtualization\n\nGartner’s Top 10 Technology Trends For 2020 That Will Shape The Future\n\n  2. ###### Internet of Things\n\n6 Emerging AI And Machine Learning Trends To Watch In 2020\n\n  3. ###### Components & Peripherals\n\nHere Is The ‘Strictly Confidential’ Xerox Offer That HP Rejected\n\n  4. ###### Security\n\nThe 10 Top News Stories Of 2019 (So Far)\n\n  5. ###### Data Center\n\nTop 12 Backup And Recovery Vendors: Gartner’s Magic Quadrant\n\n## Video\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlayNext playlist item\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:00\n\nLoaded: 0%\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently playing liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:00\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n1x\n\nChapters\n\n  * Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n  * descriptions off, selected\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * captions and subtitles off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Later that evening, he admitted that he took\nthe child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her\ninto a room and held her captive.\n\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's\nroom. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and\nhiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers,\nhaving visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\n####  Trending News\n\n  * Video shows dramatic rescue of kidnapped girl: \"We got her!\" \n  * Man arrested after 7 trafficking victims found in car: Police \n  * Jeffrey Epstein jail guards charged with falsifying records \n  * White teen accused of plotting deadly attack on black church \n  * Safety officials urge Boeing to redesign part on 737s \n\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort\nWorth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family\nfriend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police\nDepartment responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the\nfront passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into\nthe hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry\nbasket.\n\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and\nWebb eventually came out naked.\n\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in\ncustody; we have her.\"\n\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth\ndeliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping\nthe girl.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she\nand her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on\nSaturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother\nknocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and\nsmart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical\nfight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for\nand agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope\nis that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he\nwill never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney\nNealy Cox.\n\nFirst published on November 19, 2019 / 8:16 AM\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

Now they’re starting to get attention here\nin the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even—heaven\nhelp us—booyah!. Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!.\nCutting edge, I know.\n\nThese neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a\ncut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer\ndeposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.\n\nTheir come-on is that they’re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile\nalternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they’re focused on their customers’\n“financial health,” as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the “pain” that\npeople feel around their money.\n\nWhat makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a\nlittle like a neo–payday loan—your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your\nactual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the\ncompanies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging\nany overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel\na few dollars from your paycheck into savings.\n\nThese neo-banks aren’t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that\nfacilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that _are_\nbanks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown\ntechnology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course,\non your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that\nthey’re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.\n\nThe hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to\npaycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and\nresearchers believe they’re cutting into millennials’ ability to buy homes,\nhave kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have\nsome credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the\npoorer you are, the more you’re likely to have.\n\nSo what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking\nservices, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some\nbasic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?\n\nBetter banking isn’t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There’s definitely an\nambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy,\nbilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on\nthe comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees, routinely discriminated against\npeople of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really _should_ be a\nmission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it’s smart to\ncapitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.\n\nStill, it’s deeply depressing to attend a large gathering of executives,\nfounders, and industry veterans, as I did at October’s Money 20/20 conference,\nand hear the same, somber message repeated over and over again: The future of\nmoney will be predicated on the fact that the personal finances of the next\ngeneration are as fragile as a Fabergé egg. This, according to attendees and\nspeakers, is both a problem and an opportunity. No one bothered mentioning\nthat the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t technology’s problem to\nsolve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the idea that the solution to our financial woes can be found in a\nmore convenient, higher-tech, friendlier-named digital bank feels a little\nlike the last story we heard from the tech industry: That the very idea of\nwork could be disrupted by a bunch of apps, too.\n\nNo one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t\ntechnology’s problem to solve.\n\nThe same business logic—that you’re trapped in a sad, hellish existence\ndictated by megacorporations, and tech can free you like Neo from the\nMatrix—underlies the entire gig economy. It’s the basis for another tech\nveneer, this one layered over people’s inability to find meaningful work for\nreasonable pay. Uber got into the financial services game recently, with Uber\nMoney. The headline feature? Real-time earnings for drivers and delivery\npeople, so they can collect immediately, instead of weekly.\n\nIn fact, we can use the evolution of the gig economy as a case study for how\nthe latest wave of banking disruption might play out.\n\nThere was a lot that was appealing about the gig economy at first. Those Uber\n“side hustle” commercials were super cool back in 2016, when driving for Uber\nor Lyft or Postmates, or shopping for TaskRabbit or letting out a room on\nAirbnb to cover your hiked-up rent, actually seemed like an opportunity rather\nthan a necessity. Remember when this was about making “extra” money, instead\nof just barely enough?\n\nIt was only scale, and the hard realities of American economics, that made\nthese things look a little less consumer-friendly a few years later. As Uber\nand Lyft grew, driver pay went down. Word got out that unicorn-like businesses\ncould be built by replacing paid employees with a massive network of\nindependent contractors. The model spread. Enter Lugg, Instacart, DoorDash,\nGrubHub, Prime Now, and Homejoy.\n\nThis phalanx of apps comprises an army of independent contractors who hope for\nenough tips to make their labor worthwhile. As their finances have cracked\nunder the strain of small checks, no benefits, and a near-total lack of\nretirement savings, I guess it was only a matter of time before a fresh set of\napps—the neo-banks—were deployed amid the chaos.\n\nI’d like to think the mission-driven companies flooding into the US market for\nfinancial services will be better for consumers. In the short term, that seems\nplausible. Cool features, fewer fees, and a helpful person on the phone or\nonline chat could make us happy. Let’s not forget, many people really hate big\nbanks and would rather take their business elsewhere.\n\nBut there are two problems with this potential disruption.\n\nOne, it might _not_ end up being so consumer-friendly in the long run. Uber\nand Lyft ended up paying drivers less as their revenue pressure grew, and\nthey’re raising prices for consumers. Many riders will tell you the quality of\nthe driving, the cars, and the experience has declined over time, which is\nboth inevitable with growth and not surprising given the shrinking pay and\nincentives.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nSubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\n\nThat will almost certainly also be the case with these neo-banks. Banks won’t\nlie down and let the disruption happen—they’ll almost certainly buy some of\nthese upstarts and reabsorb reluctant customers. Big Tech incumbents are\nalready honing in on the space. Apple’s (issue-laden) credit card, Amazon’s\nsmall business loans and unknown future ambitions, Google’s forthcoming\nconsumer checking accounts, and Facebook’s payment wallets could all eat into\nthe market for new companies.\n\nWhether it’s due to competition from banks, each other, or bigger tech\ncompanies, neo-bank startups will inevitably go out of business, leaving\nconsumers stranded. That’s pretty disruptive when you’re talking about your\nchecking account. And at some point, the neo-banks will have to make more\nmoney, which means their offerings will get less generous over time.\n\nA second problem is more serious. Ultimately, no amount of friendly design,\naccessible features, and overdraft protections will solve the underlying\nproblems that made these services necessary in the first place. No neo-bank\ncan erase the student loan debt or the 40-year stagnation in wages or the\nunexpected medical expenses or the crippling reality of America’s existential\nbrokeness. The neo-banks have promised that they’ll ease your pain, but that’s\njust morphine for the real condition. When it comes to the actual sickness,\nyou’re still on your own.\n\n* * *\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n  * YouTubers must unionize, no matter what Google says\n  * Paid political ads are not the problem.

Classic rock may seem something of a cliché for bikers, but looking at\nshots of Freddie Spencer and Evel Knievel whilst listening to Steppenwolf\nmakes me want to get out on the bike.\n\nThere are some stunning photos in the book, but it’s disappointing to also\nfind a few low-resolution images spoiling the quality impression, as well as\nsome design touches that intrude a little too much.\n\nThis isn’t a book for fact-fiends (and being bi-lingual, half the space is\ntaken up by the German version of the text), but it’s full of iconic bikes,\npeople and kit (though where are Lewis Leathers?!). It’s a very enjoyable\ntitle to leaf through whenever you want to remember how cool you are.\n\nAdvert  \n\n[button link=”http://www.morebikes.co.uk/submit-kit-review/” type=”big”\nnewwindow=”yes”] Send us YOUR kit review[/button]\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nGet Motor Cycle Monthly delivered through your letterbox every month. 12\nissues for £11.99.

Carlos Nadalim apresenta, neste vídeo, uma loja incrível nos EUA,\nrepleta de materiais didáticos, livros e uma quantidade enorme de recursos\neducativos para crianças. Por que não temos uma assim no Brasil?\n\nAqui nos Estados Unidos você tem à disposição materiais voltados à aquisição\nda fluência em leitura. Há vários materiais, mas quero destacar um: **um\ncronômetro para que pais e professores saibam quantas palavras seus filhos e\nalunos estão lendo por minuto.**\n\nIsso é muito importante, porque a aquisição da fluência em leitura levará as\ncrianças à compreensão de textos. É por isso que aqui você vai também\nencontrar materiais voltados à compreensão de leitura. **Ou seja, uma coisa\nestá conectada à outra.**\n\nNo Brasil isso não é muito comum. Quando você fala sobre fluência de leitura,\no pessoal estranha: “Que história é essa de que uma criança de 6 anos deve ler\n60 palavras por minuto? Que absurdo é esse? Cada criança tem seu tempo”.\n\n**Só que não é isso o que a ciência cognitiva da leitura diz a respeito de\ncompreensão textual.**\n\nOutra coisa interessante aqui: a abordagem fônica é algo comum para o\namericano. Você encontra uma variedade de materiais para pais que querem\npreparar seus filhos para a alfabetização a partir, por exemplo, dos 3 anos.\n\n“Mas 3 anos, Prof. Carlos? Não é muito cedo? As crianças precisam brincar.\nOnde já se viu inseri-las no universo das letras, dos sons, etc.”\n\nPois bem, aqui nos Estados Unidos isso é muito comum, e **acontece de forma\nlúdica.**\n\n“ _3 anos, 3 anos, 3 anos…_ ” Veja, isso é tão natural aqui! “ _3 anos, 3\nanos, 3 anos…_ ” Ninguém discute isso, pois todos sabem que é muito importante\npreparar as crianças para a alfabetização formal por meio de jogos, de\natividades lúdicas, que **vão fortalecer a memória, a consciência fonológica,\na consciência fonêmica, e assim por diante.**\n\nEntão veja como os brasileiros ainda estão discutindo e vendo problemas em\ncoisas que aqui são comuns, divertidas e que só melhoram o desempenho das\ncrianças, no futuro, em leitura e escrita.\n\nTudo isso que estou dizendo é muito comum aqui também para os professores que\ntrabalham na pré-escola. Estou aqui numa seção de recursos de ensino, na qual\nhá vários professores comprando **materiais que eles utilizam com seus alunos\nem sala de aula.**\n\nEntão é isso!\n\nEspero que você tenha gostado de conhecer alguns dos materiais desta loja e\ntambém que você afaste definitivamente de sua cabeça essas idéias tolas sobre\npreparação de crianças pequenas para a alfabetização.\n\nUm forte abraço, fique com Deus e até a próxima.\n\n* * *\n\nDeixe suas dúvidas e opiniões aqui embaixo!

For this years’ edition of\n**Amsterdam Light Festival** artists, designers and architects from sixteen\ndifferent countries share their interpretation of the central theme **_‘The\nMedium is the Message’_**. All participating artworks will be lit\nsimultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition –\nin the historical center of Amsterdam – which can be experienced in different\nways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time,\nvisitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be\npresented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the\nfestival. **Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019**.\n\n_Cover image: artist’s impression of the lighting installation by Peter Koros\nDesign at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival_\n\n* * *\n\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\n\n**Ivana Jelić and Pavle Petrović** (Serbia) found inspiration for their work\n** _Starry Night_** in Van Gogh’s famous painting of the same name. Since the\nbeginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution,\nstarry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation\nStarry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night\nback, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\n\n**Groupe LAPS** (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and\noften integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the\nfestival, the French artist collective designed **_Spider on the Bridge_** :\neighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on\nthe bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion\nthat the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors\nare warned!\n\n**Amigo & amigo** (Australia) – also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone\nChua – explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their\ntechnically complex artworks. **_Parabolic Lightcloud_** is a cloud of light\nmade with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this\ninstallation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors\nto think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts.\nMoreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope\nmade out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\n\n**OGE Group** (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and\nGaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work\nis characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with\n**_Light a Wish_ **as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment\nyou blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the\nair. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions\nfloat above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the\nfestival.\n\n**Balmond Studio** (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The\nstudio’s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With\n**_Optilli,_** Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the\nsubjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon\nas the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The\nquestion is: is the displayed image correct?\n\n* * *\n\n**Light as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam**  \nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty\nartworks. This years’ exhibition revolves around the theme **_‘The Medium is\nthe Message_** ‘, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and\nphilosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the\nway we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The\nparticipating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play\nas a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise\nhave remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories\nis also a central part of this edition.  \nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of\nremarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be\nreleased as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn\nidentifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\n* * *\n\n**Some of the lighting installations on show at the 7th Amsterdam Light\nFestival – previews**\n\n_Light a Wish by OGE Group_\n\n_Parabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo_\n\n_Portam Civitatis by Peter Snijder_\n\n_Spider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS_\n\n**7th Amsterdam Light Festival**  \n**29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019**\n\n* * *\n\nsponsored links\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n## More in Amsterdam\n\n#### Amsterdam\n\n### sponsored links\n\n* * *\n\n### Search Inexhibit\n\n  \n  \n\n### InDi Design Index\n\n### Specials\n\n  * ### The design of everyday technology\n\n  * ### Visionary computer design of the past\n\n  * ### Examples of digital communication technology in culture and education\n\n  * ### Venice Art Biennale 2017 | info, program, exhibitions, and events\n\n  * ### Wood Architecture & Design\n\n  * ### 58th Venice Biennale of Art 2019 | May You Live in Interesting Times\n\n  * ### Museums of archaeology and archaeological sites around the world\n\n  * ### 16th Venice Architecture Biennale 2018 – pavilions, program, events\n\n  * ### Venice Architecture Biennale 2016 – Reporting from the Front – INDEX\n\n  * ### Venice Art Biennale 2015 – All the World’s Futures – Index\n\n### recently-added locations\n\n  * ### Mantua and Cremona\n\n  * ### Naples and Campania\n\n  * ### Chicago\n\n  * ### San Francisco\n\n  * ### Washington, D.C.\n\n  * ### Turin\n\n  * ### Dallas – Fort Worth\n\n  * ### Innsbruck and Austrian Tyrol\n\n### Subscribe to Inexhibit’s newsletter\n\n* * *\n\ncopyright Inexhibit 2019 - ISSN: 2283-5474\n\n  * About Inexhibit\n  * Copyright\n  * Contact Us\n  * Advertise\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookies\n  * Newsletter\n  * Cookie policy\n\n____\n\n__\n\n  * HOME\n  * Architecture\n  * Design\n  * Art\n  * Cities\n  * myMuseum\n  * Specials\n  * English\n    * Italian\n\n"

(NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute)\n\nSPACE\n\n#  The First Map of Saturn's Moon Titan Just Revealed Some Tantalising\nFeatures\n\nREUTERS\n\n19 NOV 2019\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global\ngeological map of Saturn's moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of\nfrozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic\nworld considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\n\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's\nCassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017.\nTitan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System's\nsecond-biggest moon behind Jupiter's Ganymede. It is larger than the planet\nMercury.\n\nOrganic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living\norganisms - play a leading role on Titan.\n\n\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many\nof us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's\nicy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory in California.\n\n\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and\nthis can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added\nLopes, who led the research published in the journal _Nature Astronomy_.\n\nThe first global geologic map of Titan. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU)\n\nOn Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On\nTitan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on\nEarth - in liquid form due to the moon's frigid climate.\n\nRainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than\nthe poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency\nresearch fellow.\n\nPlains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of\nthe surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate\nTitan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.\n\nTitan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids\non the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at\nits polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed\nportions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\n\n\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more\ncomplex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep\nsubsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.\n\nNoting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a\nhydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something\nlike it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a\nlittle warmer?\"\n\nThe map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch\nits Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's\nchemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in\n2034.\n\n\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying\naround on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"\n\n _(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown)_\n\n _© Reuters_\n\n"

One of\nAlibaba’s New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.\n\nThe Chinese company’s decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-\nviolent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing\nin the city’s status as a Asian financial hub.\n\nIt is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba’s\ninitial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then\naccept the company’s unusual governance structure.\n\nSmall investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many\nshares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can\nget, Reuters reported.\n\n  \n\n **Read more:** Tencent profit falls as Alibaba threat and economic woes weigh\n\nHong Kong’s exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small\ninvestors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.\n\nAlibaba’s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange\nnext Tuesday.\n\n _Main image credit: Getty_\n\nShare\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  *   * __\n  * __\n\n  \n  \nTags: Alibaba  \n  \n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n## Related articles\n\n##  Alibaba’s secondary Hong Kong listing gets exchange approval\n\nAnna Menin\n\n##  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba eyes $15bn Hong Kong listing in boost for\ntroubled city\n\nJames Booth\n\n##  Alibaba poised to launch record-breaking $13.4bn Hong Kong listing\n\nAnna Menin\n\n  * Business\n  * Industries\n  * Markets\n  * Technology\n  * Leadership\n  * Life & Style\n  * Money\n  * Sport\n\nFollow us for breaking news and latest updates:\n\n  *   *   * \n\n* * *\n\n  * Stay up to date:  \nSign up to our **daily newsletters**\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Newsletters\n\n    * Five at 5\n    * Midday Update\n\n  * About\n  * Advertising\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Latest Edition\n\nCopyright © 2019 CityAM.

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine\nproblems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of\nBoeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The\norder is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is\ntypically negotiated by airlines.\n\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have\nbeen badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet\nin less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of\nroughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to\nBiman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its\nlaunch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60\nof the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress,\nKazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference\nthat the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will\nrecommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of\nconsolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates\nfleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In\naddition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50\nAirbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The\nA350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the\nFrench plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-\nbody A350.\n\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest\nairliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of\nthe jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would\nscrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the\nindustry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more\nfuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * Transportation\n  * Travel\n  * Emerging markets\n  * Trade\n  * Airbus Group SE\n\nRelated\n\n  1.

The demand has US\nofficials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of\nimproved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect\nintellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back\nexisting tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of\ntariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper\nconcessions from China.\n\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger\nthan just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China\nscholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will\nagree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it\nwill benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to\nsee China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US\nmaintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to\ncampaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to\nvoters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product\npurchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand\ndictate deals instead.\n\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion\nworth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from\nthe 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and\nconsumer goods.\n\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in\nannual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he\nwould likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since\nthe trade war started in 2018.\n\nTrump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such\nconcessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual\nproperty and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a\nsecond person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed\nto any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that\nI like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an\nOctober news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could\nnow be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\n\nDH Newsletter  Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\n\nGET IT\n\nUnited States\n\nChina\n\ntrade war\n\nTrade deal\n\n0 Comments (+)\n\n###  Related stories\n\n####  India plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\n\n####  Dollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK\n\n####  China cuts new benchmark rate to boost economy\n\n####  Khamenei says enemy 'repelled' in protest-hit Iran\n\n####  Beijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\n####  Last campus protesters hold out as HK schools reopen...\n\n### DH Picks\n\n  * ####  PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr... \n\n  * ####  Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year \n\n  * ####  KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams... \n\n  * ####  Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill \n\n  * ####  Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes... \n\n##  social feed\n\n#### What does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\n  * Politics\n  * North and Central\n  * South\n  * East and Northeast\n  * West\n\nKarnataka\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Politics\n  * Districts\n\nBengaluru\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Bengaluru Crime\n  * Politics\n  * Infrastructure\n  * Life in the City\n\nSports\n\n  * Cricket\n  * ICC World Cup 2019\n  * Formula 1 with DH\n  * Football\n  * Tennis\n  * Sportscene\n  * Other Sports\n\nBusiness\n\n  * Business News\n  * Budget 2019\n  * Economy & Business\n  * Family Finance\n  * Technology\n  * DH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\n  * Videos\n  * Photos\n\nOpinion\n\n  * DH Views\n  * Editorials\n  * Panorama\n  * Comment\n  * In Perspective\n  * Right in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\n  * Entertainment News\n  * DH Talkies\n  * Arts, Books & Culture\n\nMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\nKarnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\nIndia vs Bangladesh\n\nChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\nAyodhya verdict\n\nPegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\nDH Picks\n\n  * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep \n  * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n  * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\n  * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n  * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\nLatest stories\n\n  * India plans incentives to woo 324 foreign manufacturers\n  * Dollar rises as US-China relations worsen over HK \n  * Blood-stained dress of Congress MLA in Kerala Assembly\n  * NCLAT rejects DBS Bank's plea \n  * Arrests ordered in Philippines vaping ban\n\nTrending news\n\n  * Irked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\n  * Anil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\n  * Tech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\n  * Stents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\n  * Gunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\nServices\n\n  * About\n  * Epaper\n  * Newsletter\n  * Archives\n  * Sitemap\n  * Classifieds\n  * Contact\n\nOur group sites\n\n  * Printers Mysore\n  * Prajavani\n  * Sudha\n  * Mayura\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms\n  * Disclaimer\n\n© 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n  *   *   *   *   * X Share via\n    *     *     *     * Share permalink\n\nWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user\nexperience.

How\nthe diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from\nthe fiery chaos of _the Big Bang_ remains one of the most difficult unsolved\npuzzles of _cosmology_.\n\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most\ndetailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call\nTNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains\ntens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen\nonly in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion\nparticles representing _dark matter_, gases, stars and supermassive black\nholes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\n\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key\ninsights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped\ngalaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black\nholes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two\narticles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal _Monthly\nNotices of the Royal Astronomical Society_.\n\n**Related:** _ **From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through\nTime**_\n\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the _IllustrisTNG Project_, which\naims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big\nBang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details\nof individual galaxies.\n\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting\nand understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said\nPaul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and\nco-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're\ngetting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies\nthat give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems\nlooks like as they form and evolve.\"\n\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required\n16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen _supercomputer_ in Stuttgart, Germany,\nrunning continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a\nsingle processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most\ncomputationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers\nbelieve their investment has paid off.\n\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get\nout more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max\nPlanck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the\nstudy, _said in a statement_. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had\nnot been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena\nemerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical\ningredients of our model universe.\"\n\nThe violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures\n(in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel\ncosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG\nCollaboration)\n\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe\nappears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed\nresearchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent\nclouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered\nthat the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally\nemerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including\nspiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive _black\nholes_. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life\nobservations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively\nconsistent with reality.\n\n **Related:** _ **The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe**_\n\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks,\nanother phenomenon began to emerge. _Supernova_ explosions and supermassive\nblack holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas.\nThese outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years\nabove a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back\nunto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a\nfeedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients\nfor forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's\nstructure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into\nthin rotating disks.\n\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their\nmodel. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for\nastronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations\ncompleted,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better\nunderstand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent\ntrends show up in that data.\"\n\n  *  _15 Amazing Images of Stars_\n  *  _11 Fascinating Facts About Our Milky Way Galaxy_\n  *  _The 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark Matter_\n\n _Originally published on_ _Live Science_ _._\n\n_Need more space?_ _Subscribe to our sister title \"All About Space\" Magazine_\n_for the latest amazing news from the final frontier!_ (Image credit: All\nAbout Space)\n\n###  __Sign Up for e-mail newsletters\n\nGet breaking science news on monster snakes and dinosaurs, aliens, spooky\nparticles and more!\n\nNo spam, we promise.

За их аккаунтами\nследят тысячи подписчиков, а фудблогеры, в свою очередь, радуют поклонников\nрецептами и яркими сочными постами.\n\nСамые популярные фудблогеры рассказали нам, как они решили заняться столь\nнеобычным творчеством, а также поделились эксклюзивными рецептами быстрого и\nвкусного ужина.\n\nА мы предлагаем вам выбрать самого крутого фудблогера Instagram по версии\nWday.ru!\n\nПервые три участника, набравшие большее количество голосов, получат ценные\nпризы и подарочные наборы. А с обладателем первого места ко всему прочему мы\nсделаем эксклюзивное интервью для сайта Wday.ru. Тут уж шефу будет не\nотвертеться – расспросим обо всех секретах!\n\nЧитайте, знакомьтесь, вдохновляйтесь и… голосуйте за понравившегося участника\nна последней странице!\n\n## Андрей Рудьков\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Андрея Рудькова\n\n **Аккаунт:@darkzip**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Внезапно я захотел вести блог – совершенно любой. Господи, какие только темы\nя не придумывал. Но точно знал, что из всех моих хобби не брошу только одно:\nне перестану есть. Поэтому я запустил блог, в котором рассказываю то, что сам\nузнаю о еде (потом добавил путешествия).\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Очень люблю этот вопрос, потому что всегда отвечаю одно и то же: я люблю\nвкусную кухню. Это может быть борщ, индийская курица карри или скандинавские\nсмореброды, китайские сушеные скорпионы или корейская жгучая кимчи. Если\nвкусно, значит, это моя кухня. Люблю почти все, особенно, конечно, десерты. Но\nдовольно холодно отношусь ко всяким смузи, не люблю сало и надеюсь когда-\nнибудь понять оливки.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Думаю, это будет паста. Банально, но зато всегда работает. Соусом и начинкой\nпослужит то, что будет в холодильнике. Сам я люблю потереть хороший сыр,\nдобавить молотого перца и немного томатного соуса. Если будет позволять время,\nтальятелли приготовлю сам.\n\n **Проголосовать за Андрея вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Олеся Куприн\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Олеси Куприн\n\n **Аккаунт:@okuprin**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Еда объединяет. Где бы мы ни оказались, даже не зная языка, за одним столом\nс другими людьми мы всегда найдем о чем поговорить.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Я очень любою шоколад: горький, молочный, белый, пористый, с орехами, самый\nразный! Но зато не могу пережить манные комочки и рассольник с грустными\nогурцами.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Томатный киш. Дома мы никогда не готовили традиционный киш со сливками и\nпрочими вкусными жирностями. За основу, разумеется, бралось песочное тесто, а\nвот начинкой служил творожный сыр и самые разные овощи, иногда киш случался с\nмясом, чаще с рыбой, но самый любимый был именно с помидорами. Для основы: 2\nжелтка, 150 г сливочного масла комнатной температуры, 30 г сахара, 200 г муки.\nДля начинки: 300 г творожного сыра, 300 г мягкого творога, он своей\nконсистенцией похож на сметану, 2 яйца, 2−3 томата для начинки, соль и специи\nпо вкусу.\n\nПриготовление: желтки разотрите с сахаром, затем вмешайте к ним сливочное\nмасло, оно должно подтаять при комнатной температуре и стать мягким как крем.\nК готовой консистенции просейте муку, вымешайте гладкое однородное тесто.\nТесто заверните в пленку, и уберите в холодильник на 1 час. По истечению\nвремени выньте тесто, разомните его и выложите в форму, распределите\nравномерно руками прямо в форме для выпечки. Этого количества хватит на два\nнебольших киша по 16−18 см или один большой 25−26 см. Перед запеканием тесто\nнаколите вилкой, чтобы оно не поднималось в форме, а затем запекайте основу\nдля киша при 180 градусах 12−15 минут. Ориентируйтесь по своей плите. Пока\nзапекается основа смешайте сыр, творог, яйца, соль и специи, можно\nиспользовать миксер на невысокой скорости. Помидоры нарежьте кольцами, если\nиспользуете черри их можно положить целиком. Как только основа будет готова,\nвыньте ее из духовки и охладите 8−10 минут на столе. Основа не должна\nпропечься полностью или затвердеть, тесто станет нужной консистенции при\nостывании. В остывшую основу залейте творожную смесь, выложите помидоры и\nснова уберите форму с кишем в духовку, еще на 15−18 минут, чтобы творожная\nмасса схватилась. Готовый киш выньте из духовки, он должен полностью остыть в\nформе, затем его уже можно будет нарезать для подачи.\n\n **Проголосовать за Олесю вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Евгения Левицкая\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Евгении Левицкой\n\n **Аккаунт:@evgenialevi**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Я всегда любила готовить. Мне даже больше нравится сам процесс приготовления\nблюда, а еще очень люблю собирать друзей и угощать своими шедеврами.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Три года прожила во Вьетнаме, и я просто фанат азиатской кухни. К сожалению,\nв России не все блюда можно реализовать на кухне обычной домохозяйки, но если\nесть возможность, то никогда не откажусь от вьетнамских блинчиков с\nморепродуктами и супчика фо.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Буратта с овощами и томатным соусом. Казалось бы, обычные продуты: баклажан,\nцукини, буратта и томатный соус, а столько комплиментов я давно не получала.\nВам потребуется: 1 баклажан, 1 цукини, зубчик чеснока, 1 шарик буратты, 200 мл\nтоматной пассаты. Овощи очистить от кожуры и порезать на мелкие кубики. На\nсковородку налить оливковое масло, добавить чеснок (слегка придавив его\nножом), обжарить баклажаны до золотистой корочки. Потом добавить цукини,\nнемного еще масла и снова пожарить. Посолить, поперчить. В это время в\nсотейник вылить пассату (можно заменить томатами в собственном соку, только\nблендером превратите в пюре). Поставить на сильный огонь, дать закипеть,\nубрать огонь и выпаривать, пока томаты не станут консистенции соуса. Посолить,\nпоперчить, добавить оливковое масло и смесь итальянских трав. На тарелку с\nглубоким дном выкладываем овощи, сверху соус и буратту. Подавать с кусочками\nхрустящего багета.\n\n **Проголосовать за Евгению вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Динара Снижевская\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Динары Снижевской\n\n **Аккаунт:@dinara_snizhevskaya**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— В моей семье нет ни одного человека, не умеющего и не любящего готовить! По\nтрадиции каждые выходные мы собираемся всей семьей, чтобы вкусно поесть и\nподелиться новостями. Думаю, что на выбор направления в фотографии повлияла\nмасса теплых и уютных воспоминаний, связанных с едой!\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Поскольку часть детства я прожила в Узбекистане, мои вкусовые предпочтения\nсформировались там. Я люблю узбекскую кухню с ее пестрым разнообразием и\nнасыщенностью, и, конечно же, чуть более сдержанную русскую. Со временем мне\nполюбились такие же яркие и насыщенные блюда итальянской и паназиатской\nкухонь.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Всякий раз, когда необходимо быстро приготовить вкусный ужин, я готовлю\nжареный рис по-китайски. Быстро, очень ароматно и необычайно вкусно! Для этого\nвам нужно: отварной рис – 1,5 стакана, 1 луковица, 1 столовая ложка мелко\nнатертого корня имбиря, 300 граммов куриного филе, упаковка смеси любимых\nзамороженных овощей, 15−20 мл соевого соуса, 3 шт. зеленого лука. Разогрейте в\nсковороде подсолнечное масло, мелко нарежьте лук, чеснок и обжарьте до\nзолотистого цвета с имбирем. Нарежьте соломкой курицу, добавьте к луку и\nобжаривайте еще 5−6 минут, помешивая. Затем добавьте замороженные овощи и\nобжаривайте еще 5−6 минут. Когда смесь станет румяной, всыпьте рис, влейте\nсоевый соус и жарьте еще 5 минут. Готовое блюдо украсьте зеленым луком,\nнарезанным наискосок.\n\n **Проголосовать за Динару вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Оксана Луцан\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Оксаны Луцан\n\n **Аккаунт:@bittereschokolade**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— История моего увлечения началась с выпечки.

Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Не могу отдать предпочтение какой-то определенной кухне, очень нравится\nнаходить новые рецепты и сочетания продуктов. Я много путешествую и каждый раз\nпривожу интересные идеи.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Когда продукты вкусные и свежие их хочется минимально подвергать какой-то\nтепловой обработке. Крупно нарежьте болгарский перец, кабачок кружками,\nшампиньоны разрежьте пополам, сбрызните все оливковым маслом, добавьте немного\nлимонного сока, соль и свежемолотый перец. Отдельно смешайте оливковое масло,\nложку лимонного сока, чайную ложку горчицы, соль по вкусу. Хорошо смажьте\nстейк форели или семги. Выложите рыбу с овощами на решетку и запекайте в\nдуховке в режиме гриль около 20 минут. Быстрый, вкусный и полезный ужин готов!\n\n **Проголосовать за Оксану вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Ольга Панкова\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Ольги Панковой\n\n **Аккаунт:@olga_n_photo**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Два моих самых любимых увлечения – фотография и кулинария. В какой-то момент\nони соединились в одно направление – фуд-фотографию, и я с азартом окунулась в\nэту новую необычайно увлекательную работу. Меня бесконечно вдохновляет еда!\nЛюбая. Готовые блюда, ингредиенты, их сочетания, специи, кулинарные травы,\nнапитки и все, что может быть с этим связано.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Не могу сказать, что люблю какую-то одну кухню. Скорее есть любимые блюда в\nразных кухнях мира. Это могут быть и итальянская паста вонголе, и узбекский\nплов, и белорусские драники, и французский хлеб, и десерты. А от русской\nжареной картошки с селедкой я точно никогда не откажусь! Мечтаю попробовать\nвсе кухни мира. Равнодушно отношусь только к мясу и без труда смогу без него\nпрожить.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\nДля вкусного семейного ужина у меня есть фирменный рецепт, который однажды я\nсама придумала и восхитилась результатом. Но потом в интернете нашла\nинформацию, что такой рецепт уже давно существует во французской кухне. Это\nдорада, запеченная в листьях лука порея с лаймом и травами. Рыба получается\nочень нежная, ароматная, тает во рту. На все меньше 30 минут. А пока рыба\nзапекается, я успеваю приготовить гарнир, например, отварить рис и приготовить\nсалат. На 2 порции вам понадобится 1 лук порей, 1 лайм, несколько веточек\nсвежего тимьяна, 2−3 ч. л. прованских трав, 2 ст. л. оливкового масла, соль и\nмолотый черный перец по вкусу. Разогреть духовку до 180 градусов. Противень\nзастелить пергаментом для выпечки. Рыбу очистить, выпотрошить, хорошо промыть\nвнутри и снаружи, обсушить. Натереть смесью из оливкового масла, соли, черного\nперца и прованских трав. Снять с порея несколько верхних листьев и обдать их\nгорячей водой, чтобы они стали более гибкими. Оставшийся стебель порезать\nнебольшими кольцами, выложить на противень. Нарезать лайм тонкими кольцами.\nФаршировать рыбу лаймом, веточками тимьяна. Затем на рыбу положить по 1−2\nветочки свежего тимьяна, и завернуть каждую в листы порея. Выложить на\nпротивень, сбрызнуть оливковым маслом и запекать в духовке, в течение 30−35\nминут. Подавать незамедлительно.\n\n **Проголосовать за Ольгу вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Венера Осепчук\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Венеры Осепчук\n\n **Аккаунт:@venera_os**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Кулинария – мое хобби в свободное время от работы и семьи. Я также как и\nмногие ненавижу ежедневную рутинную готовку, но зато очень люблю в свой\nвыходной день выбрать какое-нибудь новое блюдо, которое мы еще не пробовали,\nзакупить нужных продуктов, приготовить и красиво сфотографировать. Это, можно\nсказать, моя такая медитация и релакс – я кайфую от этого процесса и получаю\nудовольствие.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Очень люблю восточную кухню! Здесь на первом месте блюда турецкой и\nтатарской кухни, из азиатской – тайская кухня у нас в фаворитах, а из\nевропейской – всеми любимая средиземноморская! В общем, вы поняли, поесть мы\nлюбим.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Хочу поделиться идеей для быстрого и вкусного ужина! Паста с тунцом, в\nтоматном соусе готовится моментально и просто – за какие-то 20−30 минут.\nПонравится всем однозначно, так как к пасте мало равнодушных. На 4 порции вам\nпонадобятся: спагетти – 370 г, 3 ст. л. оливкового масла, мелко нарезанная\nпетрушка – 3 ст. л., 2−3 зубчика чеснока, 1 маленький перец чили, 1,5 см корня\nимбиря, тунец консервированный в масле – 400 гр., пассата (консервированная\nмякоть томатов) – 450−500 г, сахар – 0,5−¾ ч. л., соль и черный перец по\nвкусу. Спагетти отварить, чеснок, перец чили и петрушку мелко нарубить, имбирь\nнатереть на мелкой терке. В сотейнике разогреть оливковое масло, добавить\nподготовленные овощи и зелень – жарить все буквально 1−2 минутки. Влить\nтоматную пассату, дать закипеть. Посолить, поперчить, добавить сахар по вкусу\nи варить 3−5 минут. Тунца вынуть из банки и вилкой разломать на грубые куски\n(не мельчить), затем добавить их в томатный соус, дать закипеть, если нужно –\nеще досолить, доперчить. Положить готовые спагетти, перемешать, прогреть и\nподавать. Подаем присыпав свежей петрушкой и черным молотым перцем.\n\n **Проголосовать за Венеру вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Дарья Калугина\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Дарьи Калугиной\n\n **Аккаунт:@contrse**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Задолго до увлечения фудфотографией я занималась портретной и художественной\nсъемкой. Тогда меня интересовали только люди, с их характерами и выражениями\nсамых разных эмоций. Но в какой-то момент я поняла, что вопреки имеющемуся\nмнению, мастерства и желания фотографа создать интересный снимок недостаточно,\nнужна модель, умеющая работать перед камерой. Мне одновременно нужно было\nбольше пространства для вдохновения и больше контроля над композицией, светом\nи сюжетом. Я всегда любила еду, в моей семье был некий негласный\nгастрономический культ со сложносочиненными блюдами на завтрак, обед и ужин.\nВидимо, неизбежным было пересечение двух моих любимых занятий: снимать и есть\n(ладно, еще готовить!). Мой девиз: «Надо любить то, что делаешь, и делать то,\nчто любишь», иначе результат будет без души.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Я обычно отвечаю так: «Ем все, кроме устриц». Вкус устриц пусть останется\nнавсегда в долгой-долгой памяти. Мне нравится экспериментировать с едой. Я\nпробовала много разного и экзотического, и в кухне любой страны обязательно\nесть по крайней мере одно запоминающееся блюдо, один яркий вкус, который\nоставил неизгладимый след в моей душе гурмана.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Я сразу подумала о рыбе дорада. В моей семье это традиционное блюдо на ужин\nвыходного дня под бокал белого вина и веселые разговоры. Получается всегда\nбезумно вкусно, нежно и изысканно, а готовится практически с закрытыми\nглазами. Самое главное – выбрать хорошую рыбу. Лучше всего покупать\nохлажденную, а не мороженую. Глаза должны быть чистыми, прозрачными и\nвыпуклыми, а жабры иметь ярко-розовый, даже красноватый цвет. В противном\nслучае, рыба уже не первой свежести, а второй, как известно, не бывает. Можно\nсразу в магазине попросить, чтобы рыбу выпотрошили. Чистить ее не надо.\nИзмельчите розовую и белую соль и натрите рыбу с обеих сторон (не внутри).\nТонко нарежьте лимон и 2−3 кружка положите внутрь рыбы, и несколько сверху. По\nжеланию можете добавить пару веточек свежего розмарина или тимьяна. Мне\nнравится натуральный вкус дорада, поэтому я вообще не добавляю специи.\nПоставьте в разогретую до 190 градусов духовку на 20−30 минут (в зависимости\nот размера рыбы и типа духовки). Мясо готовой рыбы будет легко отделяться от\nкостей. Получается безумно нежно, вкусно и ароматно, буквально тает во вру!\n\n **Проголосовать за Дарью вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Ольга Аветисьянц\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Ольги Аветисьянц\n\n **Аккаунт:@olga_avet**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— К фудфотографии я пришла через увлечение кулинарией. А началось все с\nрождением дочери. Когда она чуть подросла, мы много времени проводили на кухне\nвместе. Создавали свои кулинарные истории, ароматом которых должно быть\nнаполнено детство.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Любимой кухней является итальянская. Предпочтению всегда отдам\nморепродуктам. Не могу назвать какие-то продукты, которые я категорически не\nем, все зависит от того, как это приготовлено.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Каждую пятницу мы готовим пиццу. Домашнюю, самую вкусную. Уверяю вас, дома\nможно приготовить потрясающую пиццу с хрустящей корочкой. Для теста вам\nпонадобятся: 250 мл теплой воды, 400 г муки, 2 ч. л. сухих дрожжей (или 20 г\nсвежих), 2 ст. л. сахара, 1 ч. л. соли, 3 ст. л. оливкового масла. Дрожжи\nрастворите в теплой воде, добавьте сахар и подождите, пока поднимется пенная\nшапка. Смешайте с остальными ингредиентами. Замесите тесто (я использую миксер\nс насадкой крюк). Поставьте его в теплое место на 30−40 минут и накройте\nпленкой. Данного кол-ва теста хватит на 2 пиццы (диаметр 26 см). Выпекайте\nпиццу в предварительно разогретой духовке на 300 градусов около 10 минут. Для\nлучшего результата выпечки используйте пекарский камень. Для томатного соуса\nвам понадобятся томаты в собственным соку (либо очищенные, либо уже\nпюрированные) – 500 г. Томаты необходимо потушить с оливковым маслом (пару\nстоловых ложек добавить) и специями (базилик, розмарин, тимьян, любые на ваш\nвкус) на среднем огне 10−15 минут. Можно добавить пару столовых ложек сахара,\nесли соус будет кислым (это зависит от самих томатов). Раскатать тесто для\nпиццы, смазать соусом, выложить тертую моцареллу (твердую), сулугуни (или\nбрынзу, можно еще моцареллу шариками), колбасу. Помним, что оливки, прошутто\nне выпекаются, они выкладываются на готовую пиццу. Подавать пиццу следует\nтеплую с зеленью (базилик, руколла, шпинат).\n\n **Проголосовать за Ольгу вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Катерина Каплар\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Катерины Каплар\n\n **Аккаунт:@katya_kaplar**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Я занялась фудфотографией в декрете, мне очень не хотелось выходить в офис.\nПри этом у меня была очень хорошая работа в рекламном агентстве, но стены меня\nдушили, и я это всегда осознавала. Тем более, все мои друзья говорили мне, что\nу меня хорошо получается создавать композиции, снимать еду, при этом я делала\nэто на телефон. Могу смело сказать, что меня вдохновили мои друзья и близкие\nлюди. Муж подарил фотоаппарат с объективом и потом уже не было ни дня, чтобы я\nне снимала еду. Хочу отметить, что я сейчас не только фудфотограф, но и\nорганизатор мастер-классов по фуд фотографии, которые с успехом проходят уже в\nкоторый раз (за весну, лето и осень прошло уже 7 успешных мастер классов!).\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Я люблю итальянскую и испанскую кухню. Обожаю сыры, пиццу, пасту и\nобязательно на столе должно быть много сочных овощей и вкусное вино.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Делюсь рецептом теста для пиццы. Все до безобразия просто: 175 г муки, соль\nпо вкусу, сахар по вкусу, 1 ч. л. сухих дрожжей, 1 ст. л. оливкового масла,\n125 мл теплой воды. Смешать в блендере соль, сахар, дрожжи, муку. Постепенно\nдобавить воду и масло, перемешать блендером, а потом месить руками пару минут,\nдобавляя муку, чтобы не прилипало тесто к рукам. Положить в миску, обмазать\nоливковым маслом, обернуть миску полотенцем и оставить на 1 час, чтоб тесто\nподнялось в два раза. Потом раскатываете и добавляете ингредиенты: соус из\nвяленных томатов и оливкового масла (все это перемалываю в блендере), томаты\nчерри, моцарелла, пармезан – да что угодно! По готовности уже добавляю листья\nсалата, оливковое масло и еще чуть сыра. Готовила на 200−250 градусах минут\n15−20, но тут надо уже самой смотреть – у кого какая плита.\n\n **Проголосовать за Катерину вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Эмма Матевосян\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Эммы Матевосян\n\n **Аккаунт:@delicious_tasty_**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Все началось четыре года назад, когда создала страницу в Instagram. Просто\nфотографировала то, что пекла и готовила, делилась рецептами. А когда поняла,\nчто это многим нравится, еще больше втянулась в процесс. Это доставляет мне\nбольшое удовольствие, а восхищенные отзывы подписчиков вдохновляют на новые\nподвиги.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Что касается кулинарии, я совсем не однолюб. С одинаковым наслаждением могу\nсъесть как хинкали, так и суши, например. Вот никогда не пробовала устриц, и\nнет никакого желания: почему-то уверена, что они мне совсем не понравятся.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Один из любимых быстрых салатов на ужин – красивый, вкусный и совсем не\nсложный в приготовлении. Для салата с авокадо и филе курицы вам понадобятся\n(на две порции): 150 г микса салатных листьев, 100 г куриного филе, 60 г\nредиса, половинка авокадо, 10 перепелиных яиц, 1−2 ст. л. кедровых орешков, 1\nст. л. нерафинированного оливкового масла, ароматизированная соль,\nсвежемолотый черный перец по вкусу. Яйца отварить, очистить, разрезать\nпополам. Редис помыть, очистить и тонко нарезать. Авокадо очистить и нарезать\nна тонкие дольки или кусочки. Салатные листья помыть и высушить. Куриное мясо\nмелко нарезать. Все ингредиенты смешать или выложить на тарелку слоями, полить\nоливковым маслом, добавить соль и перец по вкусу. Вместо оливкового масла\nможно использовать заправку из греческого (или натурального) йогурта, лимона,\nгорчицы и специй.\n\n **Проголосовать за Эмму вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Олег Ильин\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Олега Ильина\n\n **Аккаунт:@oleg_ilyin**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Вдохновляюсь до сих пор. Честно говоря, я вообще не знал поначалу – кем хочу\nбыть. Было много вариантов идей, задумок. Поступил после окончания школы в\nавтомобилестроительный институт, по настоянию родителей. Слава богу, уже через\n6 месяцев обучения там понял, что данное направление – ну вот совсем не мое,\nмягко говоря. Однажды купил справочник вузов и методом исключения стал\nвыбирать – куда пойти учиться. Вот так и выбрал любимое дело: наткнувшись на\nперечисление кулинарных образовательных учреждений, подумал – оно! Сначала\nдаже не о профессии кондитера подумал – а о поваре. Просто кондитер в моем\nпредставлении на тот момент – это такая добротная тетушка в засаленном халате,\nс колпаком на голове, которая пухлыми ручками месит тесто для пирогов. Но\nкулинария действительно с детства меня привлекала: в шесть лет я уже\nсамостоятельно готовил завтрак для мамы! В общем так я попал в колледж\nработников гостиниц и ресторанов. С удовольствием доучился, очень быстро начал\nработать, набивать руку, практиковаться. И мне нравилось это все. И если ты\nполучаешь удовлетворение и удовольствие от того, чем занимаешься – у тебя\nпопросту нет иного пути, кроме того, как добиться чего-то стоящего в своей\nпрофессии. Короче, попал в «кондитерку» случайно – и это стало навсегда делом\nмоей жизни, в котором не устаю развиваться и расти. Теперь я шеф-кондитер,\nвладелец двух десертных ресторанов «Кондитерская Олега Ильина».\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Мне нравится почти все. Есть буквально несколько продуктов, которые я пока\nчто не принял для себя (и то потому, что еще не подобрал правильный способ\nприготовления!): тот же булгур, допустим. Или, скажем, хумус. Как-то вот мы\nпока с ним не подружились. Кухни люблю все практически: в каждой обязательно\nнайдётся для меня что-то свое, вкусное, удивительное: кухни разные стран имеют\nразные темпераменты и характеры. Нельзя сказать, что какая-то хуже или лучше.\nПросто надо узнавать поближе. Ближе всего мне русская (так называемая) кухня:\nбогаче, наверное, сложно придумать. Мне кажется, каждый народ (а в России их\nвеликое множество) имеет свои «фирменные» блюда, заимствуя рецепты и\nкулинарные хитрости у соседей, передавая из поколения в поколение. Одной\nтолько каши (которую на Руси если и как самостоятельное блюдо и как гарнир к\nрыбе и мясу) – более ста рецептов. Выбирай на вкус. Винегрет – самый что ни на\nесть русский салат. Окрошка на квасе, ботвинья, рассольник, щи, уха – долго\nперечислять можно. Люблю нашу кухню за ее разнообразие и за то, что не нужно\nискать каких-то экзотических продуктов: все можно найти на собственном огороде\nпри желании. Питаю так же слабость к кавказской кухне. Хотя понятие это\nусловное – тут и грузинские блюда, и армянские, и азербайджанские… Но! Мясо,\nовощи, зелень, специи и красное вино – вот что их объединяет. И это\nизумительное сочетание.\n\n— Манты люблю. Узбекский плов. И высокую французскую кухню тоже. Короче\nговоря, когда бываю в новых странах – немедленно стараюсь познакомиться с\nгастрономическими особенностями. Начинаю «обход» с самых дешевых забегаловок\n(нередко там встречаются поистине фантастические традиционные блюда,\nприготовленные без прикрас, но с удивительным мастерством) и заканчиваю\nименитыми ресторанами (если есть поблизости мишленовские – обязательно иду\nтуда). Кухня и кулинария (и кондитерка, естественно!) мне интересны с самых\nразных сторон. Скажу вам так: вкусно – не значит дорого. Одно из самых\nнезабываемых мест, одно из самых «вкусных» мест, о котором я буду помнить всю\nжизнь – это столовая для рабочих рядом с овощным рынком у нас за МКАД. Меня\nоднажды туда случайно занесло. Человек я смелый и охоч до экспериментов:\nпластиковыми столами и прожженными скатертями меня не возьмешь так просто!\nЗахотелось посмотреть, попробовать. И это было здорово. Гастрономический\nоргазм какой-то. И вспоминаю с нежностью ресторан Анн-Софи Пик – единственной\nво Франции женщины-шеф-повара, получившей в гиде мишлен три звезды. В столовке\nобед обошелся мне в 400 рублей. В мишеленовском ресторане – в 800 евро.\nПоэтому могу с уверенностью заявить, что оцениваю кухню не по стоимости.\nИсключительно – по талантам.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\nВместе со своей дочерью Варей мы придумали нереально вкусное и простое в\nприготовлении блюдо – «Замешайка». Блюдо полезное, несложное и готовится из\nлюбых (практически!) продуктов, имеющихся в холодильнике. Вам нужно какое-\nнибудь мясо (куртка, индейка – идеально) или рыба. Рубите по-сельски так, от\nдуши, порционно, кладете в миску. После этого берете любые овощи, которые, на\nваш взгляд, гармонично сочетаются с выбранным мясом (рыбой), тоже режете или\nрубите (как удобно) покрупнее – и туда же, в миску. Сбрызгиваете оливковым\nмаслом, солите и перчите по вкусу, выкладываете все это в пакет для запекания\n– и час-полтора, при температуре 180−200 градусов все запекаете в духовке. Это\nнереально вкусно. Дети мои очень любят «Замешайку» и часто просят приготовить.\nПопробуйте – понравится, точно говорю!\n\n **Проголосовать за Олега вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Анна Меркурова\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Анны Меркуровой\n\n **Аккаунт:@annamerkurova**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— В детстве я наблюдала, как готовила мама, и мне очень хотелось быть такой же\nловкой, быстро и просто творить вкусные блюда для семьи. А еще я была\nполненькой, дико любила сладкое, поэтому довольно быстро научилась печь сама,\nи, наверное, поэтому к выпечке у меня особенная тяга. Даже были мысли заняться\nэтим направлением профессионально. Но в 2014 году я случайно прочитала\nинтервью Любви Моисейкиной, которая организовывала масштабный фудфотоконкурс\nChefs battle в Instagram, и решилась поучаствовать в очередном сезоне. С того\nмомента я отдала часть своего сердца фудфотографии.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Имея огромную любовь к готовке, удивительно, но каких-то особенных\nпредпочтений у меня нет. Мне нравятся простота основных ингредиентов с\nсочетанием оригинальной нотки, экспериментировать, добавляя то, что есть под\nрукой. Наверное, ближе всего итальянская и французская кухня – свежие овощи,\nассорти сыров, вкусный хрустящий багет. Но самое любимое -это, конечно, блины\nпо нашему семейному рецепту. Их предпочту взамен любому блюду! Нелюбимых\nпродуктов как таковых нет. Я считаю, что на каждый «нелюбимый» ингредиент\nнайдется тот, кто сделает из этого что-то фантастически вкусное. В этом и вся\nпрелесть готовки.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Не изменяя себе это будет один из любимых пирогов нашей семьи – пирог с\nброкколи. Вам нужны: 500 г слоеного теста, 400 г брокколи, 250−300 г мягкой\nсоленой брынзы (или фетаксы, или сиртаки), 300 г твердого сыра, 1 ч. л.\nмолотой смеси итальянских или французских трав – тимьян, базилик, эстрагон,\nчабер, 1 яйцо, 0,5 ч. л. сахара. Тесто предварительно разморозить по\nинструкции. Духовку разогреть до 180 градусов. Прямоугольную форму для выпечки\nсмазать небольшим количеством сливочного масла, подпылить мукой, на дно\nвыложить лист пекарской бумаги. Если вы используете замороженную брокколи,\nпредварительно размораживать ее не нужно; если вы используете свежий кочан –\nнеобходимо его промыть, разделить на соцветия. (ножку использовать по желанию,\nее следует нарезать мелкими кубиками). Большой сотейник наполнить водой,\nдовести до кипения, добавить брокколи, варить около 7−10 минут до средней\nмягкости. Далее воду слить, брокколи остудить. Крупные соцветия разрезать\nпополам. Мягкую брынзу нарезать кубиками, сыр натереть на крупной терке.\nРабочую поверхность и скалку подпылить мукой. Поочередно раскатать два пласта\nтеста в прямоугольник чуть больше размера вашей формы, нижний слой должен быть\nчуть толще, чем верхний. Выложить в подготовленную форму первый слой теста,\nсформировать небольшой бортик с каждой стороны высотой 1−1,5 см, всю\nповерхность теста наколоть вилкой. Далее слоями выложить брынзу, сверху\nброкколи, посыпать травами, добавить тертый сыр. Накрыть пирог вторым слоем\nтеста, края защипнуть косичкой. Яйцо разбить в стакан, добавить сахар, взбить\nвилкой. Смазать кисточкой всю поверхность пирога яичной смесью. Выпекать пирог\nоколо 25−30 минут до золотистого цвета в зависимости от мощности вашей\nдуховки. Готовый пирог достать из духовки, дать полностью остыть, нарезать\nпорционно.\n\n **Проголосовать за Анну вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Ася Воскресенская\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Аси Воскресенской\n\n **Аккаунт:@sunday_woman**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Еда не оставляет равнодушным ни одного человека, а приготовление еды –\nнастоящее искусство. Я больше всего люблю готовить выпечку и десерты. Меня\nвдохновляет и каждый раз поражает магия процесса. Как жидкий белок\nпревращается в хрустящую меренгу, как густеют сливки, превращаясь в крем, как\nрастет дрожжевое тесто. А фотография – это моя вторая давняя страсть. Так два\nхобби (приготовление еды и фотография) соединились воедино и нашли воплощение\nв моем блоге в Instagram.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Я люблю пробовать новое. Люблю интересные необычные сочетания вкусов и\nтекстур. Мне очень нравится провансальская кухня и средиземноморская с обилием\nвсевозможных морепродуктов. А из десертов больше всего люблю цветочные, со\nвкусом розы, лаванды, фиалки и, кончено, шоколадные.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Самое простое, быстрое и вариативное блюдо – это паста. Вкусную пасту можно\nприготовить практически из чего угодно. Например, для пасты с морепродуктами я\nвсегда держу в морозилке креветки или морской коктейль. Рецепт очень прост! И\nдля него вам нужны: 150 гр любимой пасты, 100 гр креветок, 70 мл 10−20%\nсливок, 1 ч. л. сливочного масла, 2 зубчика чеснока, сок 1/3 лайма, несколько\nветочек петрушки, соль и черный перец по вкусу. Чеснок крупно прорезать и\nобжарить на сливочном масле с добавлением сока лайма. Убрать чеснок и добавить\nочищенные креветки. Обжаривать, помешивая, около 3 минут. Затем влить сливки,\nпосолить и поперчить по вкусу, довести до кипения, добавить петрушку,\nперемешать и снять с огня. Пасту отварить согласно инструкции и смешать с\nсоусом с креветками. Подавать с тертым сыром пармезан.\n\n **Проголосовать за Асю вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Олеся Фисенко\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Олеси Фисенко\n\n **Аккаунты:@marjoriolesya, @recipe_nehudeem, @cooking_backstage**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Я не профессиональный фудфотограф. Нигде не училась и не снимаю для стоков\nили ресторанов. Фудфото – это одно из направлений моего основного увлечения,\nразработки рецептов. Пять лет назад, когда у меня был маленький ребенок на\nруках и несколько часов свободного времени в сутках, я искала чем заняться.\nРешила побольше готовить и разнообразить семейное меню. Искала в интернете\nрецепты, готовила… и в 9 случаях из 10 выкидывала еду. Потому что рецепты\nнаписаны так, что повторить их очень сложно, а зачастую сайты просто копируют\nдруг у друга материал: текст от одного рецепта, фото – от другого. Хочешь\nсделать хорошо – сделай сам. Так появился мой кулинарный портал Nehudeem.ru,\nгде каждый ингредиент имеет точный вес и рецепт сопровождается пошаговыми\nфотографиями.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Можно сказать, что я всеядная. Люблю азиатскую кухню, грузинскую, русскую.\nЕсть продукты, которые я не приемлю в еде – это сырые яйца и субпродукты.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Я знаю, что многие хотят расширить свой рацион рыбными блюдами, но попросту\nне знают, как рыбу лучше приготовить. Поэтому предлагаю вам отличный рецепт\nрыбы в кляре, который подойдет как взрослым, так и малышам. Готовится блюдо\nвсего 30 минут. Получается мягким, нежным и очень вкусным. На четыре порции\nвам понадобится: 700 г филе минтая, 2 ст. л. растительного масла, а для кляра\n– 2 яйца, 150 г пшеничной муки, 190 мл молока, 1/3 ч.л. соли, для посыпки – 80\nг пшеничной муки. Подавать взрослым эти «рыбные палочки» рекомендую с\nупрощенным вариантом белого соуса тартар – 100 г маринованных огурцов, 2\nзубчика чеснока, 15 гр укропа, 200 гр майонеза или сметаны. Зелень помыть.\nВключить духовку разогреваться до 180 градусов. В рецепте использовалось филе\nминтая, можно также готовить из судака, трески и другой белой рыбы, которая\nхорошо держит форму и не распадается при термической обработке. С филе белой\nрыбы аккуратно снять кожу острым ножом, вынуть пинцетом крупные кости. Филе\nнарезать брусочками толщиной 2 см. В тарелку насыпать муку для обвалки рыбы,\nостальная мука пойдет для приготовления кляра. Приготовить кляр: в миску\nразбить яйца, добавить молоко, оставшуюся муку, соль. Взбить вилкой до\nоднородного состояния. Должна получиться консистенция густого кефира, тесто\nнепрерывной струйкой стекает с ложки. В сковороду налить масло и поставить на\nсредний огонь. Кусочки рыбы обвалять в муке, полностью окунуть в кляр и\nвыкладывать на сковородку на расстоянии друг от друга. Готовить по 2−3 минуты\nс каждой стороны до легкого румяного цвета. Снять со сковородки ручку или\nпереложить рыбу в форму для запекания в один слой и готовить в середине\nразогретой духовки 7−10 минут, в зависимости от размера рыбы. Важно не\nпересушить ее. Приготовить соус: чеснок почистить, вместе с солеными огурцами\nнатереть на мелкую терку. Укроп помыть и мелко нарезать, соединить с огурцами.\nВыложить все в миску, добавить майонез. Размешать. Рыба в кляре готова.\nРекомендуем подавать с соусом тартар, свежими овощам и гарниром: отварным\nрисом, картофелем.

В какой-то момент подумала, что\nлюблю красивую и вкусную еду и мне нравится фотографировать. Решила объединить\nдва увлечения. Сразу записалась на мастер-класс по съемке еды и с тех пор ни\nдня не сомневалась, что хочу этим заниматься!\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Моя любимая кухня – итальянская. Она очень простая, но такая вкусная и\nсытная! Весь ее секрет в очень качественных продуктах и проверенных вкусовых\nсочетаниях. Любимые продукты – хороший сыр и свежий хрустящий багет. Из\nнелюбимого – манная каша. Вызывает воспоминания из школьной столовой.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Так как я люблю итальянскую кухню, то это будут спагетти с печеными томатами\nи козьим сыром. На две порции вам понадобится: 12−15 штук томатов черри, 4−5\nзубчиков чеснока, 5 веточек тимьяна, 2 ст. л. оливкового масла, соль и черный\nперец по вкусу, небольшой пучок свежего базилика, твердый козий сыр по вкусу,\n½ пачки спагетти. Зубчики чеснока очистить. Томаты черри и чеснок выложить на\nпротивень, застеленный пергаментом. Полить оливковым маслом, положить веточки\nтимьяна. Запекать в разогретой до 200 градусов духовке около 20 минут.\nСпагетти сварить по инструкции на упаковке. Сыр потереть на мелкой терке,\nбазилик мелко порубить. У готовых черри удалить кожицу. Томаты разрезать\nпополам или на четыре части. Печеный чеснок мелко порубить. Спагетти смешать с\nтоматами, чесноком и оливковым маслом, с которым они запекались. Посыпать\nчерным перцем, сыром и базиликом. Несколько черри можно оставить на ветке для\nукрашения.\n\n **Проголосовать за Марию вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Дарья Хорошавина\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Дарьи Хорошавиной\n\n **Аккаунт:@kitchenghosts**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Мне очень нравится сам процесс фудсъемки: домашний, неторопливый,\nумиротворяющий. Техника синемаграфии производит похожий эффект на людей, мне\nчасто пишут, что на мои видео можно «залипнуть».\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Я люблю готовить блюда самых разных кухонь! Обожаю делать пасту болоньезе с\nпармезаном, марроканскую шакшуку и хумус, американские черничные панкейки с\nкленовым сиропом. Сейчас мой фаворит – тайская кухня и пад тай с креветками.\nПервый раз попробовала его в Америке и настолько была поражена сочетанием\nострого кисло-сладкого соуса с рисовой лапшой и жареным арахисом, что теперь\nготовлю его почти каждую неделю. Планируем сделать с ним съемку.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Пад тай с креветками. Готовится буквально минут 15, нужно только заранее\nзамочить лапшу. Ингредиенты на 2−3 порции: рисовая лапша (не фунчоза, а\nплоская) – 300 г, овощи: болгарский перец, бобовые ростки, китайская капуста,\nлук, чеснок. По объему примерно столько же, сколько и лапши, затем – соус пад\nтай, 100 г креветок, жареный арахис, лайм. Лапшу приготовить по инструкции на\nупаковке, они бывают разные, но в основном ее нужно либо отварить несколько\nминут в кипящей воде, либо замочить на 30 минут, откинуть на дуршлаг, промыть\nхолодной водой и немного просушить. Я оставляю ее стекать в дуршлаге, пока не\nпонадобится. Креветки почистить и замариновать в соусе пад тай минут на 10.\nЛук и чеснок поджарить до золотистого цвета. Овощи мелко нашинковать, добавить\nк луку, готовить на средне-сильном огне, чтобы они поджарились, но сохранили\nупругость. Лучше это делать на вок-сковороде, но можно и на обычной. Добавить\nкреветки и жарить еще 2 минуты до их готовности. Снять с огня и отложить.\nЛапшу обжарить пару минут на кунжутном масле и еще пару минут в соусе пад тай.\nОна должна стать эластичной. Добавить в лапшу овощи с креветками, все как\nследует перемешать. Разложить лапшу по тарелкам, посыпать сверху толченым\nарахисом (я размалываю его очень мелко, практически в муку, чтобы он лучше\nприлипал к лапше), положить по дольке лайма. По вкусу можно поливать соевым,\nустричным или рыбным соусом.\n\n **Проголосовать за Дарью вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Оля Малышева\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Оли Малышевой\n\n **Аккаунт:@salatshop**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Я начала интересоваться и активно погружаться в тему здорового питания еще\n13 лет назад. Тогда вегетарианство и ЗОЖ не были таким трендом, как сегодня.\nКиноа, зеленые смузи, овощные соки, десерты без сахара и муки – тогда все это\nбыло большой редкостью в России. Здоровое питание часто ассоциировалось с\nжесткими диетами, безвкусными овощными салатами и постоянным подсчетом\nкалорий. Мне хотелось показать, что здоровое питание может быть очень вкусным,\nкрасивым и при этом простым в приготовлении. В своем блоге Salatshop я стала\nрассказывать о своем опыте, любимых книгах, специалистах и вегетарианских\nрецептах без сахара и муки.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Стараюсь, чтобы в еде было много овощей, цельные крупы, разнообразие вкусов,\nингредиентов и текстур и минимум сложностей. Вместо пшеничной муки использую\nполбяную и кукурузную. Вместо белого сахара добавляю в десерты финики, сироп\nтопинамбура или кокосовый сахар. Люблю итальянскую и грузинскую кухню. В целом\nмне понравится любая кухня, где не скупятся на овощи и любят цельные продукты.\nОбожаю специи, а также элементы тайской кухни – например, часто использую на\nсвоей кухне кокосовое молоко и слегка острыми специями. Еще я большой адепт\nсмузи и свежевыжатых соков – если знать правильные сочетания и пропорции, эти\nнапитки могут быть невероятно вкусными и очень полезными.\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Рецепт тыквенного супа с кремом из кешью. Обожаю его за нежный сливочный\nвкус и простоту приготовления. Вам потребуются: ½ небольшой тыквы, 2 средних\nморковки, 1 л воды, 1 луковица, 1 ч. л. куркумы, 2 ложки оливкового масла, ½\nлимона, 150 г нежареных кешью (замоченных на 2−3 часа), соль и перец по вкусу.\nНарезанную тыкву и морковь и отправьте в кастрюлю и залейте 1 л воды. Доведя\nдо кипения, убавьте огонь, добавьте нарезанный лук и варите до мягкости. Пока\nварится суп, приготовьте крем из кешью. Промойте заранее замоченные кешью и\nсмешайте их в блендере с 1—1,5 стаканами питьевой воды и солью. Когда овощи в\nсупе станут мягкими, добавьте куркуму и выключите огонь. Добавьте сок лимона,\nоливковое масло, соль и перец по вкусу. Влейте крем из кешью и смешайте суп\nблендером до однородной текстуры. В тарелке украсьте суп зеленью или орешками\nи скорее подавайте!\n\n **Проголосовать за Олю вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Яна Манакова\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Яны Манаковой\n\n **Аккаунт:@zygonema**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Около четырех лет назад, когда я впервые взяла в руки фотоаппарат и решила\nзаниматься фотосъемкой, я случайно наткнулась в интернете на блог одного\nзападного фудфотографа. Сейчас уже даже не вспомню, кого именно. И мой мир\nперевернулся! Таких красивых фотографий еды я никогда до этого не видела. Я\nдаже представить себе не могла, что можно так красиво снимать. Я решила тоже\nпопробовать снимать еду, до этого я снимала только людей. Стала по крупицам\nсобирать информацию по фуд съемке и фудстайлингу, готовить и сервировать\nкрасивые блюда, покупать интересную посуду, самостоятельно делать фотофоны из\nстарых досок. Так, постепенно, это стало моим хобби, а потом переросло в\nпрофессию.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может, наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— У меня нет особых предпочтений, я всеядна. На еду смотрю скорее как на\nобъект для съемки, чем как на лакомство. Но в чем никогда не могу себе\nотказать, так это в фастфуде!\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Гамбургеры со свекольным кетчупом. На два 2 гамбургера вам понадобится: для\nсвекольного кетчупа – 1 средняя свекла (весом примерно 150 г) – отварить и\nостудить, 2,5 ч.л. бальзамического уксуса, 2 ст.л. оливкового масла, 1−2 ч. л.\nмеда, соль, перец по вкусу, 2 булочки для гамбургеров (разрезать вдоль), 3−4\nст. л. оливкового масла для обжаривания, 150 г вешенок, 300 г говяжьего фарша,\n2 яйца, 1 маленькая красная луковица (нарезать тонкими кольцами), 20 г зелени\nкольраби-кресс. Приготовить кетчуп из свеклы: свеклу измельчить в блендере до\nсостояния пюре, добавить бальзамический уксус, оливковое масло, мед, соль и\nперец, тщательно перемешать. Булочки обжарить с внутренней стороны на\nраскаленной сковороде без масла, в течении нескольких минут, до образования\nзолотистой корочки. Вешенки разделить на небольшие соцветия и обжарить на\nоливковом масле с двух сторон, слегка придавливая сверху, до образования\nкорочки. Посолить, поперчить. Из говяжьего фарша сформировать две котлеты по\nразмеру булочек. Обжарить на оливковом масле до необходимой степени прожарки.\nЯйца пожарить в виде глазуньи. Собрать гамбургеры.\n\n **Проголосовать за Яну вы можете на последней странице!**\n\n## Алла Ершова\n\nФото:\n\n    личный архив Аллы Ершовой\n\n **Аккаунт:@baking_maniac**\n\n **Что вас вдохновило на создание кулинарной страницы?**\n\n— Еда – мой фетиш и один из главных источников удовольствия. Несколько лет\nназад попробовав приготовить дома некоторые мои любимые десерты, поняла, что\nполучаются они аппетитнее тех, что я когда-либо ела в кафе и ресторанах.\nЖелание отменно поесть у меня всегда было сильнее лени, поэтому я стала\nготовить все чаще и чаще, пристрастила к десертам членов своей семьи, друзей,\nа потом просто не смогла остановиться. Сейчас я даже не знаю, что доставляет\nмне большее наслаждение – вкусная еда или ее приготовление.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами? Есть ли какие-то предпочтения, а может наоборот,\nесть блюда или продукты, которые вам не нравятся?**\n\n— Обожаю итальянскую кухню во всем многообразии ее региональных вариаций!\nМногие «гурманы» считают ее слишком простой, но мне кажется, именно в этом и\nзаключается вся прелесть. Привлекает особенное отношение к еде в Италии – с\nискренней любовью и уважением. Семейные рецепты бережно хранятся и передаются\nиз поколения в поколение. Блюда готовятся преимущественно из натуральных\nсезонных продуктов – из того, что есть дома в настоящий момент. В процессе\nприготовления продукты не теряют своих вкусовых качеств, а, напротив, зачастую\nраскрывают их в выгодном свете. Ну и, конечно, культура неспешной трапезы –\nвот, где истинный slow food! Как кондитер не могу не упомянуть о любимых\nдесертах – это сицилийские трубочки канолли и меренговый десерт «Павлова»\n(вовсе не итальянский, но обожаемый всей душой). Могу есть их каждый день на\nзавтрак, обед и ужин!\n\n **Эксклюзивный рецепт для быстрого ужина.**\n\n— Сейчас я готовлюсь к отпуску, поэтому поделюсь классным рецептом простого в\nприготовлении и легкого салата с киноа и молодым горошком. На две порции вам\nнужно: 85 г киноа, 100 г феты или брынзы, 25 стручков горошка, 50 г рукколы, 2\nяйца, оливковое масло, сок 1 лимона, соль и перец по вкусу. Залить киноа\nхолодной водой и оставить на 15 минут. Слить воду. Переложить крупу в сотейник\nи залить водой (воды должно быть в 2 раза больше по объёму, чем крупы).\nДовести до кипения, уменьшить огонь и продолжать варить до готовности примерно\n15 минут (воды не должно остаться, а крупа быть рассыпчатой). В конце варки\nдобавьте соль (по желанию). Отварить яйцо всмятку, залить холодной водой и\nоставить на 5−7 минут. Очистить от скорлупы. Для приготовления заправки\nсмешать оливковое масло, сок лимона, соль и перец, хорошенько взбить. В\nтарелку выложить руколу, охлажденное киноа, порезанную кубиками брынзу или\nфету и зеленый горошек, слегка перемешать.

Приготовление: разогреть духовку до\n230−250 градусов вместе с огнеупорной формой для запекания. Куриное филе\nпомыть, обсушить, нарезать на порционные куски (одно филе – 4−5 кусков).\nЗапанировать каждый кусочек куриного филе в сухарях. Аккуратно достать\nогнеупорную форму, добавить растительное масло, насыпать половину соли и\nвыложить куриное филе, посолить кусочки сверху, поставить в духовку на 10\nминут. По прошествии 10 минут достать форму, перевернуть кусочки филе,\nположить на каждый по пластинке сливочного масла и вернуть в духовку еще на 10\nминут. Готовое филе сервировать на тарелки, дать отдохнуть в течение 5 минут и\nможно подавать.

Так как кормила\nдочку грудью, искала варианты полезной и в тоже время вкусной еды, скорее не\nеды, а десертов, потому что сладкоежка! Хочу отметить, что от сахара и от\nмусорной еды я отказалась еще задолго до беременности. Еда моя была чистой\nводы правильным питанием (ПП). Курогрудка, греча, контейнеры на работу и типа\nтого. Из десертов всякие вариации обезжиренного творога со стевией. Потом\nзабеременела. Первый триместр меня жутко тошнило. Здесь я ПП забросила, потому\nчто надо было есть хоть что-то. Нет, я не стала есть только фастфуд и все\nтакое, просто позволяла себе больше вкусняшек, но в меру. За всю беременность\nнабрала кг 10. В планах вернуться к ПП было сразу после родов, так как кормить\nсобиралась грудью. Но не тут то было! К той пэпэшной еде возвращаться совсем\nне хотелось, хотелось чего-то другого! Ну и наткнулась в ИГ на смузи и там\nпошло поехало. Сначала это были просто смузи, потом смузибоулы, сыроедческие\nторты, конфеты. Первое время просто любовалась зарубежными картинками со\nсмузи, готовила сама и съедала. Потом решила создать свою страничку уже со\nсвоими фотками и рецептами.\n\n **Какую кухню любите сами?

Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro\nelectric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range.\nUS range is yet to be tested.\n\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of\nthe original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet\nwide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive\nside profile.\n\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts\nin light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the\nindividual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi\nsays, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road\n– such as markings – with extra-precision.\n\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED\nclusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a\nnew Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch\ntrims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody\nprotection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be\nfinished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging\nflap.\n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air\nsuspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper,\nand larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there\nare body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A\nblack styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and\nbumper.\n\nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the\nstandard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag.\nHowever US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal\nregulations.\n\n## Power and Performance\n\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the\ne-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery\ncapacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That\npromises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6\nseconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps\non the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of\ntorque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7\nseconds.\n\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic\nbrakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with\nseven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can\nlower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its\nheight by a total of 3-inches.\n\n## Range and Charging\n\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the\ne-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though,\nthat those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more\ngenerous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual\nside mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that\nthe Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty\nminutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22\nkW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge\n– which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by\nplugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\n\n## Interior and Technology\n\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom\nversus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re\nlooking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to\n58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi\nvirtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system.\nThere’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with\noptional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option,\nas will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone\nbox which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper\ntouchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the\n8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is\noptional.\n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing,\nwhile navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon\nAlexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning,\nremote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a\nnew “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and\ninfotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent\nbasis.\n\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi\nassist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic\nassistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise,\nturn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park\nassist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi\nfits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve\nultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick\nthings off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch\nedition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro\n($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron\nSportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next\nyear.\n\n## Story Timeline\n\n  * Audi e-tron GT Concept First Drive: Welcome to the future\n  * 2019 Audi e-tron Review: Grading on a Curve\n\n###### __2020 Audi e-tron Sportback Gallery\n\n  \n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Reddit\n  * \n\nTopics AudiEVLA Auto Show 2019luxury\n\nMust Read Bits & Bytes\n\n  * ## Google Play Store needs more than AI to make app recommendations useful\n\n  * ## 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback revealed as electric 4-door coupe\n\n  * ## Pokemon Sword and Shield first impressions: My kingdom for a Bulbasaur\n\n  * ## Pokemon GO creators’ next big game: CATAN World Explorers\n\n  * ## Sony bets on artificial intelligence with new Sony AI global division\n\n### Site Information\n\nAbout / Advertise / Tip Us / Contact\n\n### Policies\n\nEditorial Standards / Ethics Statement / Privacy Policy / Terms of Use  \n© 2005-2019 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.\n\n### Social and Media\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n  * RSS Feed\n\n"

In fact, Nissan still believes\nin sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\n\nAfter debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers\noff the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is\npaired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been\nredesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\n\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the\nU.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the\nall-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality,\ntechnology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic\ndesign cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,” said\nDavid Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at\nNissan North America Inc.\n\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front\ngrill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also\nhas a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier\ndesign. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated\nfinish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke\nalloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\n\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality\nmaterials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are\nall wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up\nthe overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and\nfront passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come\nwith a heated function.\n\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes\nstandard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It\nalso doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows\nfor safer parking / maneuvering.\n\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the\nprevious 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of\ntorque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared\nto the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new\n2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\n\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra.\nThese include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision\nwarning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver\nassist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear\nautomatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\n\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when\nwill this arrive in the Philippines, we're not entirely sure yet but it could\nmake its ASEAN debut at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show. But will we\nstill call it the Sylphy once it arrives here? Let's wait and see.\n\n\\- Next Auto News __\n\n##### Audi e-Tron Sportback makes electric crossovers look good\n\nAudi’s second electric vehicle – the E-Tron Sportback – officially debuts\n\n__ Jose Altoveros __ 2019-11-20 14:35:08\n\n__ Previous Auto News -\n\n##### 2020 Mini JCW GP is a 300HP monster hatch\n\nThe most powerful Mini hot hatch to come out of Oxford has 306 HP and a huge\nrear wing\n\n__ 2019-11-20 17:27:46 __ Marcus De Guzman\n\n__ Tags:2020 nissan sentra v-motion\n\n__ MORE STORIES LIKE THIS ONE\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### LA 2016: Turbocharged Nissan Sentra Nismo unleashed\n\n__November 16, 2016\n\nFEATURES\n\n##### Elite Exaltas: the Nissan nicknames\n\n__December 18, 2015\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Sentra I-Style Makes a Statement\n\n__August 18, 2005\n\nFEATURES\n\n##### The Nissan Northern Xperience\n\n__June 15, 2010\n\nFEATURES\n\n##### On track with the 2014 Nissan Sylphy and Altima\n\n__May 27, 2014\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### All-new Nissan Sentra 200 Drives to Dealerships\n\n__July 30, 2010\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Los Angeles 2015: Nissan Sentra debuts with refreshed design, tech\n\n__November 20, 2015\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Boosted 2017 Nissan Sentra SR Turbo launched\n\n__September 12, 2016\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments\npowered by Disqus\n\n__ FIND YOUR NEXT CAR\n\nChoose vehicle brand AbarthAlfa RomeoAston\nMartinAudiBAICBentleyBMWBYDChanganChevroletChryslerDodgeFerrariFordFotonGACGeelyGreat\nWallHaimaHondaHyundaiIsuzuJACJaguarJeepJMCJoylongKiaLamborghiniLand\nRoverLexusLifanLotusMahindraMaseratiMaxusMazdaMercedes-\nBenzMGMiniMitsubishiNissanPeugeotPorscheRamRolls-\nRoyceSsangYongSubaruSuzukiTataToyotaVolkswagenVolvo Choose model\n\n__ RECENT ARTICLES\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Aston Martin DBX SUV is what 007 drives when he has kids\n\nAston Martin officially reveals 2020 DBX with 550 horsepower V8 from the\nVantage\n\n__Jose Altoveros\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Mini JCW GP is a 300HP monster hatch\n\nThe most powerful Mini hot hatch to come out of Oxford has 306 HP and a huge\nrear wing\n\n__Marcus De Guzman\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Audi e-Tron Sportback makes electric crossovers look good\n\nAudi’s second electric vehicle – the E-Tron Sportback – officially debuts\n\n__Jose Altoveros\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Renault to challenge Xpander, Avanza with 7-seat 2020 Triber\n\nRenault's latest seven-seater MPV only measures less than 4 meters long\n\n__Marcus De Guzman\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Lexus wants you to go topless with 2020 LC500 Convertible\n\nLexus expands LC model lineup by offering LC 500 Convertible\n\n__Jose Altoveros\n\n__ POPULAR THIS WEEK\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, G4: This is it\n\nIs Mitsubishi Motors Philippines about to launch the 2020 Mirage (and Mirage\nG4) soon too?\n\n__Anton Andres\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Hours after reveal, 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, Mirage G4 get kitted out\n\nLess than a day since its reveal, Mitsubishi already decks out the Mirage\nhatch and Mirage G4\n\n__Anton Andres\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Ford Ranger FX4: coming soon to PH?\n\nLike the previous model, the new Ford Ranger FX4 is two-wheel drive only\n\n__Anton Andres\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Chevrolet Colorado RS isn't what you think it is\n\nChevrolet adds some visual spice to the Colorado with the limited RS model\n\n__Anton Andres\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Mitsubishi Triton Athlete is a sticker happy Strada\n\nMitsubishi Strada gets blacked out on the outside, goes all orange on the\ninside\n\n__Anton Andres\n\n__\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n  * Buyers Guide\n  * Auto News\n  * Car Reviews\n  * Transport & Logistics\n  * Features\n  * Truck & Bus Features\n  * Auto Shows\n  * Inside Man\n  * Editor's Note\n  * Motorsports\n\n* * *\n\nAutoIndustriya.com is the leading automotive resource for the Philippines.\nFeaturing daily headlines and breaking news from the Philippine auto industry\nand around the world.

Hours later, she woke up as a different person — and became a\ngreat songwriter.\n\nDavid Ehrlich\n\nNov 13, 2019 4:26 pm\n\n@davidehrlich\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n  * Share This Article \n  * Reddit \n  * LinkedIn \n  * WhatsApp \n  * Email \n  * Print \n  * Talk \n\n“Wild Rose”\n\nThe bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-\nwrite the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of\n“Wild Rose” — easily the year’s best original movie song — began 10 years ago,\nwhen the “Melvin and Howard” star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling\nlike her mind was on fire.\n\n“I felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,” Steenburgen\nsaid. “The best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was\nonly music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my\nthoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldn’t get my\nmind into any other mode.”\n\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way — the late neurologist\nwrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book\n“Musicophilia” — Steenburgen wasn’t thrilled about the sudden mental shift.\nThe next two months were tough. “I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t have acted,” she\nsaid. “I couldn’t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I\nwere kind of frightened about it.”\n\n### Related\n\n  * 'And Then We Danced' Returns Queer Film to Political Relevance With Global Impact \n  * 'Waves': Why Taylor Russell Is One of Oscar Season's Biggest Revelations \n\n### Related\n\n  * How to Watch and Livestream This Week's Impeachment Hearings \n  * Golden Globes 2020 Predictions: Best Actor and Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie \n\nSteenburgen’s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (“The Discovery,” “The One I\nLove”), also remembers it as a trying time. “If your mom comes to you after\nsurgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think it’s totally fair\nto think that she’s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,” he said.\n“All of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up\nrandom instruments — I’m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me _nuts_\n,” McDowell laughed. “When I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was\ndefinitely a change.”\n\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn’t\nexactly itching to do something else. “I had been somebody who really liked\nmusic,” she said, “but I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with\n_acting_ , and that felt like a big enough subject for me.”\n\nWhen the music didn’t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do\nsomething with it — if only for her sanity — even though she didn’t know how\nto play an instrument. “I called a very talented friend of mine on Martha’s\nVineyard and I said: ‘Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in\nmy head, could you help me make them into songs?’” she said. She wrote\nhundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer\nunder her mother’s name. “He wanted to work with ‘Nellie Wall,’ but then I\nshowed up instead,” she said.\n\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a\nsongwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a\nstrange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley’s\ndoorstep almost a decade later.\n\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper — a young British filmmaker hot off\ndirecting a lush BBC adaptation of “War & Peace” — had just found his next\nproject. He’d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called\n“Wild Rose,” a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian\ncountry singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline\nballads at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley — who landed a key role in “War\n& Peace” after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition “I’d Do\nAnything” — had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones\nthat she was perfect for the part.\n\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie\ntogether didn’t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that\nRose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she’s\nlearned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both\nfeel a little more special, but no details. Phoning in from London, Harper\nremembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece:\n“The script just said something along the lines of, ‘Rose-Lynn sings an\nincredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom\nand kids and everyone’s uplifted. The end,’” Harper said. “I had faith that we\ncould figure it out, but it was really worrying.” Universal’s music division\nprovided some demos, but none of them clicked.\n\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called “Glasgow (“No Place Like Home”).\n“It grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,” he said. “It just\n_connected_.” Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of “Fargo,” had a\nsimilar experience: “It was just that immediate feeling of ‘ _this is the\nsong_.’”\n\nThat’s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found\nthemselves blindsided by “the Mary Steenburgen of it all.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px;\noverflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\"\nclass=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her\nown dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her\nfame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than\nRose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. “It was terrifying,” she said.\n“The first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my\nhotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought ‘Why would anyone be so\nstupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?’”\n\nBut she also felt like she didn’t have much of a choice. “I was back at it by\nthe next morning,” she said. “I just told myself: ‘I’m going to go right up\nand sing the bleeping song if it kills me!’” Not long after that, Steenburgen\nbought a house in Nashville.\n\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to\nscat in the backseat of his car. “It could have been really easy for Mary\nSteenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the\nusual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn’t do that,” she said.\n“She put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to\nadmit, she’s gotten really good at the accordion.”\n\nSteenburgen’s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the\ncompetition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for “Wild Rose”\nwere content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there,\nSteenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her\nto play. “I fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was\nlooking at such a small part of the story without it,” she said. “Where does\nRose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of\nimagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the\ncinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people\nyou haven’t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the\nwhole thing, I understood what we were writing.”\n\nThat process led to a realization: “It was a really love song from Rose-Lynn\nto her mother …It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the\nconcept of home and the fact that home doesn’t have to be second best for her\nor something that she settles for.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px;\noverflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\"\nclass=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the\ntelevision show “Nashville,” Steenburgen’s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate\nYork came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of\nwriting character-driven chords. “It’s a totally different muscle,” York said.\n“You have to take yourself out of it a little bit — it’s kind of like acting,\nI guess.” Smith agreed: “It’s a different job altogether. If you’re just\nwriting a song for someone else, it’s wide open and sometimes hard to figure\nout. And if you’re writing for yourself, you’re really digging into your own\nheart.” This particular task was a little bit of both. “I feel like we could\nget into the guts of this song because we’ve all lived a similar crazy dream\nstory,” Smith said.\n\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so\nthe three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA\n(not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it\ncameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on\nsomething with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the\nsongwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn’s\nlife, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\n\n“Anything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,” Steenburgen said. “So\nI called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny\nand ended up like a sister,” a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot\nof the film. “So I called her up and said ‘Talk to me in your accent — talk to\nme about you.’ And through that we wound up with images like the opening line:\n‘I’ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.’”\n\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours — which,\nwhen you listen to “Glasgow,” seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen\nto co-write it. “It may sound shallow or like it’s a factory when I talk about\nhow fast we write these things,” Steenburgen said, “but I always think of it\nlike this: ‘I can’t take days to do a scene.’ I can’t say ‘I don’t know what\nthe emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?’ I’m\nalways having to tell stories on a time limit.” Steenburgen has only found one\ndrawback to collaborating with Smith and York: “They’re such good singers that\npeople are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, ‘Well I can’t sing\nlike that, so I’m not doing that song.’”\n\n“Wild Rose”\n\n1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\n\nBuckley, who hadn’t sung in a long time before the production, worried about\ndoing justice to a song like “Glasgow,” especially given that she had no\nbackground in country music. “But the story of it really moved me,” she said,\n“so I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just\ntried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.”\n\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-\nsurprised: “It made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex\nunderstanding of character — someone who was able to kind of go right to the\nroot of what this woman’s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that\nexposed the cracks under the surface,” she said.\n\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew\na distinction with her character. “I told her my secrets and she told me hers\nand we built a different person together,” she said. “‘Glasgow’ is a song of\nbelonging. It’s about stretching yourself to places that you don’t know are\nwithin yourself.” For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to\nsing about. “This song was such a gift to me,” she said. In turn, it also\nbecame her gift to the women who wrote it.\n\nSteenburgen called Buckley’s performance “stunning,” but seemed changed by the\nexperience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved.\n“Music is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was\nsomehow granted access to it,” she said. “It was so overwhelming for me in the\nbeginning because I didn’t grow up with having that voice in my head, like\nKate and Caitlyn did.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px;\noverflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\"\nclass=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film’s last scene\nconveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It\nbegins with Buckley’s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn\nsummons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She\napologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to\nescape: “I pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.”\n\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the\nfirst ray of sunshine after a squall: It’s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn’s\nway towards a place she never could have imagined before. “Had to find my own\nway, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,” she sings. “Ain’t\nno yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that’s stronger\nthan stone.”\n\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who’s\ntunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley’s voice swells from low to high and\nback again. She sings on behalf of anyone who’s ever had to learn about\nthemselves the hard way: “Ain’t no place like home,” she and Rose-Lynn sing\ntogether, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along\nwith all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the\n12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It’s staggering.\n\nIt’s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet,\nhappiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When\nSteenburgen’s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird\nquirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she’d had since\nshe was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new\nreality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her\nnow, it sounds like she’s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\n\n“I didn’t fall out of love with acting when this happened,” Steenburgen said,\n“and I still haven’t. But there’s so much more capability in our brains than\nwe probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a\nchoice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don’t really have to\ndo that.”\n\n&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px;\noverflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\"\nclass=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n_“Wild Rose” is now available on DVD and VOD._\n\n###  Popular on IndieWire\n\n**Sign Up:**Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

We’re on it.’ They just might be.\n\nUpdated Nov 19, 9:41 AM;Posted Nov 18, 8:19 PM\n\nAlex Wong | Getty Images\n\nKristi Noem, governor of South Dakota, pictured at the White House turkey\npardon in 2018, when she was a congresswoman. Her new anti-meth campaign is\nraising eyebrows.\n\nBy  Amy Kuperinsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\n\nRemember New Jersey’s epic quest to find a state slogan?\n\n(We never did settle on one, unlike our 565 municipalities, which are packed\nwith them.)\n\nEnter South Dakota to throw down the gauntlet. The state’s new slogan for an\nanti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social\nmedia Monday.\n\nJust what is this priceless slogan?\n\n **“Meth. We’re on it.”**\n\nYes, that’s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know\nthat her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. _On it_!\n\nOf course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that\nFlorida Man will have to up the ante next time.\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on\nTwitter pointed it out.\n\n> Yes this is real and yes the state spent nearly half a million dollars on\n> it: https://t.co/Nc0nKoXGBP\n>\n> — Dianna E. Anderson 🏳️‍🌈 (@diannaeanderson) November 18, 2019\n\nSo many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state\nand “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends.\n\nAccording to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem\nlaunched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth\ncrisis.\n\n“Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which\npeople say, “I’m on meth.”\n\nThe report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the\ncampaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.\n\n> Oh, no. It seems like the rest of South Dakota's anti-drug campaigns are\n> just as bad as the \"Meth. We're On It.\" campaign. pic.twitter.com/3BDnrvkoms\n>\n> — Mike Beauvais (@MikeBeauvais) November 18, 2019\n\n> on. meth. dot. com.  \n>  \n> meth.  \n>  \n> we’re. on. it. https://t.co/HO1ZRs9T1P\n>\n> — tall glass of coquito 🎄 (@_orabora) November 19, 2019\n\nNoem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan.\n\n“Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,” Noem\ntweeted. “So I think that’s working.”\n\nShe proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website\nfor the initiative, which contains the following statement:\n\n“South Dakota has a problem. There isn’t a single solution because meth is\nwidespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take\nover counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.”\n\n> Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness. So I\n> think that’s working... #thanks #MethWeAreOnIt  \n>  \n> ⬇️⬇️⬇️https://t.co/hopPjqa95w\n>\n> — Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) November 18, 2019\n\nStill, this isn’t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota.\n\nConsider this 2014 entry — “Don’t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers\nfrom jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads.\n\nThe road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew\nenough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety.\n\n> While we focus on South Dakota’s “Meth. We’re on it.” ad campaign, we should\n> not forget the state’s failed “Don’t Jerk and Drive” campaign from\n> 2014.https://t.co/hFciHO5Qc7 pic.twitter.com/KQLpngeTbO\n>\n> — Cooper Lund (@cooperlund) November 18, 2019\n\n_Have a tip?

Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear\njam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon,\nnutmeg, ginger, and clove, this **honey pear jam** recipe will have you\nspreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It’s so easy and delicious that you’ll\nwant to make some extra for yourself!\n\nIs there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a\ndollop of jam? Especially _homemade jam_. Not many things are more homey and\ncomforting than jam that has been made in someone’s kitchen. Up until not too\nlong ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards.\nJam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made,\nand then I tried it. Honestly, it’s so easy that anyone can do it with a few\nsimple ingredients and not much equipment.\n\n* * *\n\n### Related post: Pickled Brussels Sprouts Recipe\n\n* * *\n\n## WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAM\n\nDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don’t know. Help!\n\nThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a\npressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water\nbath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain\nstockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They\nalso come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from\ncoming in contact with the bottom of the canner.\n\nIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce\njelly jars), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water.\nYou could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs\nmade specifically to fit over mason jars.\n\n## MAKING SPICED HONEY PEAR JAM\n\nNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe\npears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves,\nand a 16-ounce Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar. Before getting\nyour jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it\nto simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam.\n\nCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To\nthe pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test\nit to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the\nfruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices\nand pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let\nthe mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes.\n\n## HOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\n\nWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the\nmixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been\ngoing a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend\nthat, so please pour slowly and carefully.\n\nNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the\ncanner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a\ntime. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If\nyou live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to\nadjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are\nat 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If\nyour jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take\n24-48 hours to really look like jam.\n\n## GIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAM\n\nIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so\nmany ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift\nbasket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass\nthem out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your\ngift, it’s sure to be a winner.\n\nDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece\nof fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a\nribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you\nwish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers.\n\n## USING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\n\nI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when\nsubstituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount.\nFor instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar,\nbut I only use a cup and a half of honey.\n\nBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or\nhomemade vanilla scones.\n\n## Spiced Honey Pear Jam\n\nPrint\n\n### Ingredients\n\n####\n\n  * 8-9 ripe pears, cored and peeled\n  * 1 lemon, or about 1/4 cup lemon juice\n  * 6 tbsp fruit pectin powder\n  * 1 tsp cinnamon\n  * 1 tsp nutmeg\n  * 1 tsp ground ginger\n  * 1/2 tsp ground cloves\n  * 1 jar Don Victor® Honey, or 1 1/2 cups\n\n### Instructions\n\n  1. Fill canner with water and set it to simmer. Add empty jelly jars to sterilize and warm.\n  2. Core, peel, and cube the pears and put them in a pot. Add the juice of one lemon, spices, and fruit pectin. Boil while stirring frequently for about a minute\n  3. Add 1 1/2 cups Don Victor® Honey and boil until thickened enough to stick to the spoon.\n  4. Spoon jam mixture into jelly jars, put the top on, and put them in a water bath canner, increasing the heat to a easy boil.\n  5. Boil for *10 minutes (if over 1000 feet, adjust for altitude)\n  6. Remove from canner and allow to cool. Jam will set within 24-48 hours.\n\n© Regan\n\n### You may also like:\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\nSharing is caring!\n\n858shares\n\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Mix\n  * Flipboard\n  * Reddit\n\nbreakfastcanningeasy recipesfruit vegetablesjamsponsored\n\n__2 comments\n\n1 __\n\n __Facebook __Twitter __Pinterest __Email\n\n##### Regan\n\nRegan is a Southeastern Connecticut native now living in Central Massachusetts\nwith her husband, two sons, and two cats.

However, it would have\nbeen helpful if you had included the amount of prepared fruit. I had to guess.\nMy pears came from a friend’s tree and were all different sizes. I used\napproximately 7 cups of fruit, which I think could’ve been a little more than\nneeded, but still turned out good. The recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of fruit\npectin which is one tablespoon more than a box of Sure Jell. I had to open\nanother box for 1 tablespoon. I really hated doing that. I will have to find\nsomething that uses less than a box. Someone who is new to jam making might\nhave a bit of a problem with this recipe. It was worth the effort, but needs a\nlittle more information. The cook time after the honey is added should also be\nincluded in the recipe. Thanks for sharing it; I’m glad that I had an\nopportunity to try it.\n\nReply\n\nRegan __August 19, 2019 - 5:48 pm\n\nHi Cherie,\n\nI’m glad you liked it and thanks for your feedback. I used a jar of pectin so\nthe number of tablespoons I used was my personal preference for consistency,\nbut if you are using a box then you could probably do with just the five\ntablespoons if the consistency is to your liking with that amount.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Comment Cancel Reply\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\nNotify me via e-mail if anyone answers my comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Staying on the Moon and reaching Mars, however, haven’t. Why?\nBecause space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\nIt is for that reason that the United States's space agency NASA on Monday\nenlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space\nindustry’s upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s\nSpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon\nshot.\n\n#### More:\n\n  * #### The New Space Race\n\n  * #### Spacewalking into 'her-story'\n\n  * #### China completes landing test for its first Mars mission in 2020\n\n“We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had\nenhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator\nfor exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference\ncall with media.\n\n“This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon\nas soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human\nexploration standpoint,” he said.\n\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for\ncontracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments,\nand to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the\nspace agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next\nyear, only two committed  to that timeline.\n\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the\nInspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted\n“technical challenges, cost increases and  schedule delays”. The report and\nMonday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020\nbudget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even\nfeasible.\n\nIn May, NASA’s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was\nnecessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to\nMars. Today that mission scope may well have expanded to Jupiter’s moon\nEuropa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water\nvapour above that moon’s icy crust.\n\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential\ningredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water -\nare on Europa.\n\nCloser to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of\neligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased\nthe total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue\nOrigin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been\non last year’s original list.\n\n“We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that\nare taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice\npresident of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting\ntimes. We’re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\n\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted\nto expand their services to include passengers.\n\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two\nrelatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite\nSystems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a\ncombined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n“Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires\nan entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and\nFounder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n“There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX\nand Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players.\nAnd we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity\nthat adds to the mix.”\n\nSOURCE: Al Jazeera News\n\n* * *\n\n### ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLaura Winter\n\n* * *\n\n  * Science & Technology\n  * Space\n  * United States\n  * Business & Economy\n  * US & Canada\n\nHave your say.Give us feedback.\n\nSign up for ourNewsletter.\n\n* * *\n\n  * News\n  * Programmes\n  * Opinion\n  * About\n  * Investigations\n  * Contact Us\n  * Video\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS\n  * Podcast\n  * YouTube\n  * SnapChat\n\n###  About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Code of Ethics\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Cookie Preferences\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * Work for us\n  * HR Quality\n\n###  Connect\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Apps\n  * Social\n  * Channel Finder\n  * TV Schedule\n  * Podcasts\n  * Newsletter\n  * Submit a Tip\n  * Directory\n\n###  Our Channels\n\n  * Al Jazeera Arabic\n  * Al Jazeera English\n  * Al Jazeera Mubasher\n  * Al Jazeera Documentary\n  * Al Jazeera Balkans\n  * AJ+\n\n###  Our Network\n\n  * Jetty\n  * Al Jazeera Centre for Studies\n  * Al Jazeera Media Institute\n  * Learn Arabic\n  * Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\n  * Al Jazeera Forum\n  * Al Jazeera Film Festival\n  * Al Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\n© 2019 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"

To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this\nparticular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love\nExperience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has\nbeen a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the\npast six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that\nchange has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to\nwork as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry.\nAlso, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and\nevery day!\n\n#### **Q: What’s the one thing you’ve learned in your past roles that is the\nmost helpful as CEO?**\n\nA: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a\nperson is coming from is the biggest lesson I’ve learned. I would also add\nbeing comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You\nmust be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a\nrapidly evolving market, you’re never going to always have 100 percent\ncomplete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that\nreality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\n\n#### **Q: How do you prioritize your day?**\n\nA: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits\nof Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits – “Put first things\nfirst”, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the\ntop of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller\nitems on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for\nemails so I’m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at\nhand.\n\n> The best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our\n> outstanding 350 partners - you couldn’t ask for better of either. Our\n> employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I’m honored to serve them\n> every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry.\n> Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things\n> with us, which is priceless.\n\n#### **Q: What’s on the horizon for the business?**\n\nA: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to\nconsumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a\nflat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a\ndedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section\njust for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the\nindustry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new\nway to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to\ntarget fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we’ll be much more\nintelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the\ntechnology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience – we can’t\nwait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\n\n#### **Q: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the\nmost?**\n\nA: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the\nbusiness each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the\nnumber of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships\nregularly. This is something I knew intellectually coming into the role, but\nthe need to balance the internal and external relationships with employees,\nclients, strategic partners, media, etc.. requires a clear plan and direct\napproach.\n\n#### **Q: In reading the SportsBusiness Journal, it was noted that you’ve been\nnamed a 40 Under 40 Award recipient. Congratulations!!! What’s it like to be\nnamed a 40 Under 40?**\n\nA: I am very honored to be on the SBJ 40 Under 40 list. It’s a very\nprestigious group of folks this year – and in years past – and I am so\nappreciative of the recognition. I thank my family and the wonderful people I\nwork with for their encouragement and support. It really means a lot and I\nshare this recognition with the entire Experience team.\n\nOk, now for a little fun.\n\n#### **Q: Where did you grow up?**\n\nA: St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands – the most beautiful 87 square miles\nin the world (I am biased) and home of five time NBA champion Tim Duncan.\n\n#### **Q: Favorite childhood memory?**\n\nA: Trip to Disney World\n\n#### **Q: Favorite apps?**\n\nA: Bleacher Report, Uber Eats, and ParkMobile\n\n#### **Q: Favorite artists or groups?**\n\nA: Bob Marley, Bruno Mars, Drake, The Eagles, Jay Z, Frank Sinatra\n\n#### **Q: Favorite books?**\n\nA: A Fistful of Rice and The Hard Thing About Hard Things\n\n#### **Q: Favorite live event you’ve ever attended?**\n\nA: Broncos vs. Raiders at Mile High Stadium in the Peyton Manning record\nbreaking season. He threw five touchdowns and the crowd was absolutely\nrocking!\n\n#### **Q: Favorite athlete?**\n\nA: Lebron James\n\n#### **Q: Favorite places you have visited?**\n\nA: Tie between Istanbul, Turkey and Cape Town, South Africa\n\n#### **Q: Most memorable live event experience?**\n\nA: Watching from courtside as Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant scored 50\nplus points a piece in a triple overtime game in their last season in Oklahoma\nCity Thunder – AND, seeing Adele live in concert – she brought the house down!\n\n#### **Q: What are your hobbies?**\n\nA: Watching NBA League Pass, reading, travel, and spending time with my\nfamily.\n\n#### **Q: Favorite technology purchase in the last 5 years**\n\nA: Sonos – Music is the soundtrack to your life and the ability to fill your\nhouse with those sounds at the touch of a button is amazing. Also, they do it\nin an incredibly simple way.\n\nThanks Junior!\n\n« Previous Post Next Post »\n\n  * Categories: \n    * Fan Testimonial\n    * How To\n    * Opinions\n    * Partner Announcement\n    * Partner Success\n    * Press\n    * Pro Tips\n    * Research\n    * Solutions\n    * Spotlight\n    * Updates\n\n# Other pages\n\n## Experience\n\n  * Who We Are\n  * Our Team\n  * Work With Us\n  * Press/Media Center\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\n## Solutions\n\n  * Mobile Commerce\n  * Ticketing Technology\n  * Data Solutions\n\n## Community\n\n  * Blog\n  * Engineering Blog\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\nOur mobile commerce, flexible ticket sales, and data solutions empower sports\nand entertainment leaders to generate new revenue streams, sell more tickets,\nand make smarter decisions.\n\nContact us 3535 Piedmont Rd NE #415 Atlanta, GA 30305\n\n© 2019 Experience\n\n"

Wait,\nwhat?\n\nThe drama began earlier this year when Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big\nMachine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which\nalready held a stake in Ithaca, is part of a growing number of PE shops\ngetting involved in the music industry.\n\nWhy? Because, capitalism, of course. You see, owning music catalogs has become\nan incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks\nbegin circling*\n\n **Back to Taylor! It’s her music, so why can’t she sing it?**\n\nIt’s complicated.\n\nAccording to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka\noriginal recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the\nAmerican Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to\ntheir original recordings. What isn't as common is a label not allowing an\nartist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in\nSwift's case ... most of her music) benefits the owner and the artist\nfinancially.\n\n**He said, she said**\n\nT-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The\nCarlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ...\nbecause hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has\ndenied Swift’s claims, saying they were “shocking and false.” And Taylor Swift\nfans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\n\n **The bottom line ...**\n\nTaylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she’ll be\nre-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher. Which versions play on the\nradio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to\nBig Machine and The Carlyle Group.\n\nMoving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music\nGroup, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder: \"what did we do to\ndeserve this?\"\n\n _Why Can’t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

        "articleBody": "Zurück zur Übersicht\n\nVon Moritz Bachmann publiziert am 25. September 2018\n\n# Die elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) – der lange Marsch ins Digitale\nGesundheitswesen\n\nDie Digitalisierung als Wachstums- und Entwicklungstreiber zieht sich bereits\nheute durch fast alle Branchen und Anwendungsgebiete, sei es im Finanzbereich,\nder Industrie oder eben auch im Bereich Healthcare. Auch wenn nicht jedes\nGeschäftsmodell von Disruption bzw. Digital Darwinismus bedroht ist, bieten\nneue Technologien Potenziale für mehr Effizienz, bessere Prozesse und zur\nKostenersparnis.\n\nIm Bereich der Gesundheitsversorgung in Krankenhäusern ist dieser Aspekt ein\nbesonders wichtiger. Durch die Festlegung von Fallpauschalen und\nSonderentgelten besteht ein hoher Kostendruck. Der Bedarf an mehr Effizienz\ndurch Digitalisierung bleibt nicht nur wünschenswert, er ist zwingend\nnotwendig. Damit das gelingt, ist der Einsatz von geeigneten interoperablen\nLösungen entscheidend.  \nDas Thema mit dem höchsten Potenzial aber auch mit den meisten Hindernissen\nwird seit Jahren intensiv diskutiert: Die elektronische Patientenakte (ePA)\n\n### Status Quo\n\n#### Analoge Prozesse\n\nIn Deutschland liegen Patientendaten in internen Systemen vor – Sei es in\nKrankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) oder im Praxisverwaltungssystem (PVS)\nniedergelassener Ärzte. Auch die Dokumentation von weiteren Befunden ist in\nder Regel ein manueller Vorgang. Zwischen einzelnen Leistungserbringern werden\nPatienteninformationen, Befunde, Röntgenbilder teils digital, z.B. durch\neinrichtungsinterne Informationssysteme, aber auch analog in Form der\nFieberkurve in der Behandlungskette weitergereicht. Handschriftliche\nDokumentationen und postalischer Versand und Empfang sind fehleranfällig.\nBehandelnde Mediziner sind dabei nicht immer auf dem aktuellsten Stand,\nerhalten wichtige Patientendaten gar nicht oder zu spät und müssen Zeit für\ndie Konsultation mit Kollegen aufwenden. Langwierige Behandlungszeiträume aber\nauch doppelt geführte oder unvollständige Patientenakten sind die Folge. Durch\nunnötige Überbehandlung und Dokumentation sowie Behandlungsfehler entstehen so\njährlich Kosten in Milliardenhöhe.\n\n#### Einrichtungsübergreifende Intransparenzen\n\nAufgrund des medizinischen Fortschritts sind Behandlungszentren und\nEinrichtungen aber auch die einzelnen Berufsgruppen im Gesundheitswesen\nhochdifferenziert. Je nach Diagnose und Krankheitsbild werden Untersuchungen\nund Therapien für Patienten in arbeitsteiligen, teils parallel ablaufenden\nProzessen und über mehrere Fachkliniken, Fachbereiche und Akteure abgebildet.\nDie so entstehenden Versorgungsketten sind zwischen den Einrichtungen nur lose\nbis gar nicht verzahnt, so dass es zu Brüchen in der Informationskette und\nIntransparenzen kommt. Das unzureichende oder fehlende Wissen über den\naktuellen Behandlungs- und Gesundheitsstatus eines Patienten erschwert die\nweitere Behandlung und wirkt sich negativ auf die Patientensicherheit und die\nKosteneffizenz der Leistungserbringer aus. Durch fehlende Interoperabilität\nzwischen den unterschiedlichen Informationssystemen sind\nGesundheitseinrichtungen, Ärzte und Patienten digital voneinander entkoppelt.\n\n#### Der Patient als Informationsquelle und -Verteiler\n\nDurch die fehlende Synchronisation von Patientendaten zwischen verschiedenen\nEinrichtungen in der Versorgungskette kommt dem Patienten eine besondere Rolle\nals Informationsübermittler zu. Einerseits muss er möglichst lückenlos über\nseine bisherige Krankengeschichte (je nach Fall über mehrere Jahre in die\nVergangenheit) berichten können aber auch medizinisches Fachpersonal\nhinsichtlich bestehender Vorerkrankungen, Medikation, Unverträglichkeiten,\nAllergien, etc. aufklären können. Gerade bei älteren oder geistig\nbeeinträchtigten Patienten sind Informationslücken oft unvermeidlich.\nZusätzlich werden Dokumente wie Arztbriefe oder Ergebnisse aus bildgebenden\nVerfahren dem Patienten bei der Entlassung/Überstellung persönlich mitgegeben.\nDamit trägt der Patient auch selbst ein unnötig hohes Maß an Verantwortung für\neinen optimalen Behandlungsverlauf und dessen Dauer.\n\nDie elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) soll diesen Herausforderungen begegnen\nund bildet aktuell das Kernthema in deutschen Krankenhäusern und\nPflegeeinrichtungen in puncto Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens.\n\n### Die elektronische Patientenakte – viele Modelle und kaum Vernetzung\n\n#### Aktuelle Situation\n\nBereits 2004 mit dem GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz wurde die ePA als eine der\nAnwendungen der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte (eGK) genannt. Seit dem wurde\nmehr als eine Milliarde Euro in das Projekt investiert und noch immer nutzen\nPatienten in Deutschland keine elektronische Gesundheitskarte.\n\nIn dem 2015 verabschiedeten E-Health-Gesetz wurde die ePA als wesentlicher\nTeil der künftigen Telematikinfrastruktur (TI) genannt. Die TI, welche von der\nBetriebsgesellschaft gematik entwickelt wird, soll dabei das digitale\nKommunikationsnetz und die Grundlage für die ePA und das elektronische\nPatientenfach bilden. Bis zum 01.01.2019 sollen alle Ärzte, Psychotherapeuten,\nKrankenhäuser und anderen Akteure des Gesundheitswesens daran angebunden sein.\n\nLaut Gesetz soll die ePA den Not­fall­daten­satz, den Medikationsplan,\nArztbriefe und weitere medizinische Dokumente, wie etwa den elektronischen\nImpfpass, aufnehmen.\n\nAnders als das ebenfalls vorgesehene ePF, erfordert die ePA als\nZugriffsberechtigung den elektronischen Heilberufsausweis des behandelnden\nArztes. Im ePF wiederrum sollen dem Versicherten die Inhalte seiner\nPatientenakte in ein sogenanntes Patientenfach gespiegelt werden, damit der\nPatient auch unabhängig von einem Arztbesuch darauf zugreifen kann. Über die\nDaten der Akte hinaus, soll der Patient hier auch die Möglichkeit erhalten,\npersönliche Gesundheitsdaten einzutragen.\n\nMit einheitlichen Standards und Spezifikationen sollen Insellösungen vermieden\nwerden. Im E-Health Gesetz ist davon allerdings nichts zu lesen. Dafür\nexistierten heute bereits parallel verschiedene gesetzliche Grundlagen zur\nUmsetzung von elektronischen Akten:\n\n  * In § 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 4 SGB V - elektronische Patientenakte\n  * in § 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 5 SGB V - elektronisches Patientenfach\n  * in § 68 SGB V - elektronische Gesundheitsakte\n  * in § 630f BGB – elektronische Arztakte\n\nMilliardenschwere Digitalprojekte auf Basis von confusion-by-design haben es\nschwer. Daher ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, dass bereits ein E-Health\nGesetz II in Arbeit ist. In der Zwischenzeit haben bereits einige Versicherer\nIhre eigenen Pilotprojekte in Betrieb genommen. Natürlich mit unterschiedliche\nStrategien und mit unterschiedlichen Varianten der elektronischen\nPatientenakte.\n\n#### Varianten von Patientenakten\n\n  * Einrichtungsübergreifende Patientenakte (eEPA)  \nBei diesem Konzept werden alle Informationen die bei der Behandlungen eines\nPatienten anfallen für Gesundheitsversorgungseinrichtungen fallübergreifend\nhinweg bereitgestellt. Eintragungen erfolgen ausschließlich über Ärzte und\nähnliche Behandlungsmitglieder. Die Akte wird dauerhaft geführt, so dass eine\ngesamtheitliche Versorgung des Patienten über alle bisherigen oder bestehenden\nKrankheiten möglich ist. Einträge können von Leistungserbringern über ein\nPortal oder über das Primärsystem heraus an die eEPA übermittelt werden – Die\nInteroperabilität zwischen den Systemen vorausgesetzt. Die eEPA sieht abseits\nvon der Datenfreigabe keine Einsicht oder Mitwirkung durch den Patienten\nselbst vor.\n\n  * Elektronische Fallakte (eFA)  \nDie eFA ist ärztlich geführt und moderiert. Sie wird einrichtungsübergreifend\neingesetzt und ausschließlich fallbezogen geführt. Die eFA hat zum Ziel, eine\noptimale Koordination der Versorgung in den einzelnen Behandlungseinrichtungen\nzu ermöglichen. Im Gegensatz zur eEPA wird sie nach Fallabschluss geschlossen,\nder Lebenszyklus der Akte fällt dementsprechend kurz aus. Die Daten in der eFA\nwerden über die Primärsysteme zur Verfügung gestellt. Auch hier gibt der\nPatient seine Einwilligung über die Datennutzung generell, ein Zugriff auf\nPatientenseite findet nicht statt.\n\n  * Persönliche, einrichtungsübergreifende Gesundheits- und Patientenakte (PEPA)  \nDieses Konzept bindet den Patienten bei der Bereitstellung, Einsicht und\nFreigabe von Gesundheitsdaten aktiv mit ein. Über ein Patientenportal hat der\nPatient die Möglichkeit z.B. Arztbriefe selbstständig einzustellen (Patienten-\nSelbstmanagement). Auch hat der Patient die Möglichkeit selbst zu bestimmen,\nwelche Daten in der Akte gespeichert werden und wer darauf Zugriff haben soll.\nDie PEPA ist wie die ePA eine fallübergreifende bzw. lebenslange Akte und wird\nsowohl vom Patienten als auch Ärzten dezentral oder über angebundene\nPrimärsysteme gepflegt.\n\n  * Elektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA)  \nDie elektronische Gesundheitsakte wird häufig mit der elektronischen\nPatientenakte gleichgesetzt. Da letztere aber bis auf die PEPA rein ärztlich\ngeführt ist, ist die eGA so ausgelegt, dass der Patient alleiniger Herr seiner\nDaten ist und diese beliebig anreichern kann. Versicherte sollen selbst\nentscheiden können, welche Diagnosen oder Medikamente sie darauf speichern\nmöchten und wem sie Einsicht gewähren wollen. Voraussetzung ist, dass die eGA\ndas Erheben, Verarbeiten und Nutzen von Daten über Befunde, Diagnosen,\nTherapien, Behandlungsberichte sowie Impfungen für eine fall- und\neinrichtungsübergreifende Dokumentation über den Patienten unterstützt\n\n#### Technische Standards\n\nAus der Notwendigkeit einer einheitlichen Kommunikation und der Herstellung\nvon Interoperabilität, haben sich verschiedene Standards entwickelt, die den\ntechnischen Kontext für elektronische Patientenakten bilden.\n\n  * Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHR)  \nIHE ist eine internationale, gemeinnützige Initiative aus Industrie und\nFachanwendern, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat, die Interoperabilität zwischen\nIT-Systemen im Gesundheitswesen sicherzustellen. Die von IHE entwickelten\nStandards (IHE-Profile) unterstützen eine Vielzahl klinischer Prozesse und\nenthalten auch optionale Funktionen und sind bestimmten Domänen z.B. für\nAugenheilkunde, Radiologie, Technische Infrastruktur, etc. zugeordnet. Für den\nEinsatz von elektronischen Patientenakten ist das IHE Profil XDS (Cross-\nEnterprise Dokument Sharing) hervorzuheben, welches eine standardisierte\nSpezifikation für die gemeinsame, einrichtungsübergreifende Nutzung von\nDokumenten beschreibt.\n\n  * HL7  \nHL7 ist, ähnlich wie IHR, eine internationale Gruppe, die einheitliche\nStandards für den Datenaustausch zwischen verschiedenen\nGesundheitsinstitutionen- und Systemen entwickelt. Die entwickelten Normen\nhaben die Interoperabilität von verschiedenen Herstellern und Betreibern zum\nZiel z.B. zwischen Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) und\nPraxisverwaltungssystemen (PVS) niedergelassener Ärzte. Der aktuellste\nStandard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) vereinigt die\nVorteile der etablierten HL7-Standard-Produktlinien und aktuellen Web-\nStandards (z.B. XML, JSON, ATOM, HTTPS, OAuth) und legt Wert auf einfache\nImplementierbarkeit und unterstützt die Entwicklung von mobile und cloud-\nbasierte Anwendungen.  \n  \n\n  * DICOM®  \nDICOM® steht für Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine und ist der\ninternationale Standard zum Übertragen, Speichern, Abrufen, Drucken,\nVerarbeiten und Anzeigen von medizinischen Bildinformationen. Die meisten\nHersteller von Systeme für bildgebende Verfahren wie Röntgen, MRT, CT haben\nden Standard in ihren Produkten implementiert. Dadurch wird eine hohe\nInteroperabilität im Umfeld verschiedener Gesundheitseinrichtungen ermöglicht.\nDICOM bildet auch die Grundlage für die digitale Bildarchivierungsystemen sog.\nPicture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).\n\n#### Aktuelle Praxisbeispiele\n\n**Vivy-App**\n\nDie vom gleichnamigen Unternehmen entwickelte App „Vivy“ wurde in Kooperation\nvon 90 gesetzlichen Krankenkassen und vier privaten Krankenversicherungen auf\nden Weg gebracht. Die in einem deutschen Rechenzentrum gespeicherten Daten\nsind Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselt und können über ein gekoppeltes Smartphone mit\n2-Faktor-Authentifizierung vom Patienten eingesehen werden. Die App ermöglicht\nden Upload von medizinischen Daten und Dokumenten. Die App soll nicht nur die\nGesundheitsakte sondern zudem den Impfpass, den Medikationsplan, Notfalldaten,\neinen Gesundheits-Check sowie eine Arztsuche beinhalten. Mittels Barcode-Scan\nvon Medikamenten sollen auch mögliche Wechselwirkungen aufgezeigt werden. Da\ndie App das DICOM-Format beherrscht, können auch Daten wie aus bildgebenden\nVerfahren importiert werden. Der Patient entscheidet, welche Informationen er\nmit Ärzten und Gesundheitseinrichtungen teilt und kann auch Dokumente löschen.\nBeim Verlust des Schlüssel sind die Daten allerdings unwiederbringlich\nverloren. Vivy soll als persönliche Gesundheitsassistent-App für 25 Mio.\nVersicherte kostenfrei zur Verfügung gestellt werden.  \n  \n\n**TK-Safe – Techniker Krankenkasse**\n\nEin ähnliches Konzept wie Vivy stellte Ende April die Techniker Krankenkasse\nmit ihrer bundesweiten elektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA) namens TK-Safe vor.\nDie zusammen mit IBM entwickelte eGA ermöglicht es den Versicherten, alle der\nTK vorliegenden Daten über ihr Smartphone in ihre Akte zu laden. Dazu zählen\nImpfungen, verordnete Medikamente, ärztliche Diagnosen oder auch Röntgenbilder\noder Entlassungsdokumente. Die Daten werden zentral Secure Cloud von IBM in\nFrankfurt am Main gespeichert und sind Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselt. Zur\nSicherheitsinfrastruktur gehört eine Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung aus\nregis­triertem Smartphone und Passworteingabe, bevor der Versicherte in seine\neGA gelangt. Auch hier bedeutet der Verlust des Schlüssel einen unweigerlichen\nVerlust der Daten.Weder die TK noch IBM haben Zugriff auf die Daten und der\nPatient allein entscheidet ob und ich welchem Umfang ärztliches Personal\ndarauf Zugriff erhalten.\n\nBislang werden die Daten bei Versicherungswechsel oder bei 12-monatiger\nNichtnutzung nach 28 Tagen gelöscht. Perspektivisch soll es aber auch möglich\nsein, die Daten zu anderen Versicherung mitzunehmen. Eine spätere Anbindung an\ndie Telematikinfrastruktur ist geplant. TK-Safe soll künftig mit dem\nelektronischen Patientenfach kompatibel sein. Das Partnernetzwerk umfasst 16\nKliniken und Betreibergesellschaften wie Agaplesion, die Helios Kliniken,\nVivantes und dem Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf. TK-Safe steht\nbundesweit ca. 10 Mio. Versicherten zur Verfügung.  \n  \n\n**PEPA – Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg (UKHD)**\n\nDas Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg bietet bereits seit 2014 eine persönliche,\neinrichtungsübergreifende Gesundheits- und Patientenakte für Patienten im\nRhein-Neckar-Raum an. Relevante Dokumente und Bilddaten können über\nstandardisierte Schnittstellen Die Primärsysteme der teilnehmenden\nEinrichtungen werden auf Basis internationaler und offener Standards (HL7,\nDICOM) sowie Profile (IHE) in die PEPA für die Übermittlung von Inhalten\nintegriert. Voraussetzung dafür ist die Einwilligung des Patienten. Die\nEinwilligung erfolgt direkt vor Ort im jeweiligen System des\nKooperationspartners (Krankenhausinformationssystem oder\nPraxisverwaltungssystem). Auf diese Weise kann der Patient für jede\nEinrichtung separat entscheiden, ob und wem er Zugriff auf seine\nGesundheitsdaten ermöglichen möchte. Sämtliche Daten liegen auf gesicherten\nServern des UKHD. Über das persönliche Patientenportal können Nutzer auf Ihre\nPEPA jederzeit zugreifen, Zugriffsfreigaben managen und sehen wer die Daten\nverwendet hat. Zusätzlich sind im Portal zertifizierte Informationsmaterialien\nabrufbar, die dabei helfen komplexe Befunde zu verstehen. Features wie ein\nMedikationsplan oder die Möglichkeit ein Sport- oder Schmerztagebuch zu führen\nsind ebenfalls integriert. Fragebögen für Forschungszwecke können auch direkt\nüber das Smartphone beantwortet werden, sofern der Patient hierfür seine\nEinwilligung erteilt. Künftig soll die PEPA auch mit der eGA TK-Safe vernetzt\nwerden, so dass die Daten zwischen den Systemen ausgetauscht werden können. An\ndie PEPA sind aktuell das UKHD und die Thoraxklinik Heidelberg sowie regionale\nPraxen angeschlossen. Das Krankenhaus Salem in Heidelberg und das\nKreiskrankenhaus Bergstraße sind in Vorbereitung für eine Anbindung.\n\n### Fazit\n\nAktuell tritt genau das ein, was von Seiten der Politik, Spitzenverbänden aus\nMedizin und Versicherern und Ärzteschaft vermieden werden sollte: Die\nEntstehung von Insellösungen. Durch fehlende Spezifikationen, langwierige\nEntwicklungsprozesse bei der TI, ePA/ePF und fehlende gesetzliche\nRahmenbedingungen entwickeln Akteure im Gesundheitswesen und Ihre Partner\neigene Lösungen.\n\nEine übergreifende Interoperabilität zwischen den Systemen scheint aber noch\nin weiter Ferne, vor allem da noch viele Versicherer keine eigene ePA-\nStrategie entwickelt haben und die künftige Telematikinfrastruktur weiter auf\nsich warten lässt. Bei über 70 Mio. gesetzlich Versicherter in Deutschland\nerreichen die bisherigen Konzepte daher noch nicht einmal die Hälfte aller\nmöglichen Nutzer in Deutschland.  \nAuf der anderen Seite darf für Kliniken und Ärzte die Dokumentation in der ePA\nzu keinem bürokratischen Mehraufwand führen, was eine tiefe Integration in die\ngenutzten Primärsysteme erfordert. Bislang können diese entscheiden, auf\nwelches Konzept sie mit aufspringen wollen. Ob sich dieses am Ende durchsetzt\nbzw. für einen übergreifenden Datenaustausch verfügbar, bleibt offen. Die\nAuswahl der \"richtigen\" Lösung ist damit entscheidend für den Einstieg in die\ndigitale Patientenakte und für nachhaltige Kostenersparnisse im\nGesundheitssektor.\n\n### Über **Moritz Bachmann**\n\nAls Inbound Sales Manager bildet Moritz Bachmann die Schnittstelle zwischen\ndem internen Online-Marketing und dem Bereich Sales bei comwrap.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday\nhighs earlier in the session.\n\nTraders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and\nChina could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to\ndrift and bond prices to go higher.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if\nno deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war.

It will house the local police\nforce's offices, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The house's future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that\nthis building will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism,\"\nInterior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn, who serves in a provisional government of\ncivil servants, said in the statement.\n\nArchitects from across the European Union will be invited to submit plans for\nthe building's redesign this month and a jury of experts and public officials\nwill pick the winning design in the first half of next year, the Interior\nMinistry said.\n\nAlthough Hitler was born in Braunau in 1889, Austria argued for decades that\nit was the first victim of National Socialism, having been annexed by Hitler's\nGermany in 1938.\n\nRecent governments have, however, recognized that Austrians were also\nperpetrators of Nazi crimes and that there was little resistance to Hitler's\nrule.\n\nReuters\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Careers\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * NBCNews.COM Site Map\n  * Advertise\n  * AdChoices\n\n© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\n  *   *   * \n\n"

Designed specifically for Intensive\nCare Units and released by Ascom, this innovative solution helps healthcare\nprofessionals gain instant visibility to patient status.\n\n  \nBAAR, SWITZERLAND  \n\nBased on Ascom’s connectivity, clinical workflow and mobility expertise, the\nDigistat Patient Watch solution provides clinicians throughout Europe with an\ninnovative solution to address the needs of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This\npartnership further expands the existing global relationship between GE and\nAscom.\n\nIn traditional ICUs, each patient is wired to up to ten medical equipment –\nfrom monitoring devices to ventilators or infusion pumps. These high-end\ntechnologies provide clinicians with critical information and alert them when\nstaff intervention is required. But this can sometimes lead to alarm fatigue,\nwith care givers being exposed to up to 1,000 alarms per shift[1], even though\nup to 99% of those do not even require clinical intervention[2].\n\nThe new alarm management solution called Digistat Patient Watch, collects data\nfrom a variety of devices connected to the patient providing a holistic view\nat the patient bedside level and at the ICU level. Clinicians gain visibility\non patient status, highlighting alarms and warnings occurring on any connected\ndevice. This critical data can also be displayed on a handheld mobile device,\nsuch as the Ascom Myco 2 which is designed specifically for clinical staff.\nThe benefits for healthcare professionals may include helping improve staff\nefficiency, supporting better organization of patient care and implementing\nprocedures to reduce the number of alarms.\n\n“Digistat Patient Watch helps clinicians leverage patient data to increase\nsituational awareness and align priorities. It has the potential to change\ntheir practice and improve workflow efficiency” says André Neu, Head of\nPlatform Solutions for Ascom.\n\n“Digistat Patient Watch is an important addition to GE Healthcare’s portfolio\nof solutions for the Intensive Care, and we are delighted with this expanded\ncollaboration with Ascom”, adds Olivier Bosc, General Manager of Life Care\nSolutions Europe at GE Healthcare.\n\nFor more information on the Digistat Patient Watch solution, as well as on\nAscom’s innovative clinical care solutions, please visit: www.ascom.com\n\n[1] Alarm fatigue: impacts on patient safety, Ruskin KJ, Hueske-Kraus D.

(AP) — The Latest on a deadly stabbing on a San Francisco Bay\nArea commuter train (all times local):\n\n10 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say a stabbing that killed a passenger on a San Francisco Bay Area\ncommuter train may have occurred after the attacker tried to steal another\nrider’s shoes.\n\nThe fight broke out Tuesday afternoon on a BART train pulling into a station\nin Hayward.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle says police are looking into whether the victim\nwas a good Samaritan who tried to stop the suspect from stealing items from\nanother person, possibly shoes.\n\nThe man ran from the station. The Chronicle says he was arrested a block away\nafter employees of a car dealership said he tried to steal a van.\n\nEmployee Steve Castro tells the paper that he fought with the shirtless man,\nwho snatched the keys from his hand as he was showing the van to a customer.\n\n___\n\n4:14 p.m.\n\nA California transit chief says a man has been stabbed to death on a San\nFrancisco Bay Area commuter train during a fight.\n\nInterim BART Police Chief Ed Alvarez told reporters at a news conference that\nofficials began receiving 911 calls Tuesday afternoon about a fight aboard a\ntrain between two men.\n\nHe says transit officers boarded the train at the next stop and found a man\nbleeding, who was possibly the victim of a stabbing. He says the man died.\n\nAlvarez says transit officers quickly searched the area and were able to\napprehend a suspect.\n\nHe said there is no threat to the public because it was a fight between two\npeople who engaged each other.\n\nOfficials did not immediately provide any other details.\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 1\n\n#####  This Bay Area zip code ranks as the most expensive in the country\n\n  * 2\n\n#####  Witness cheered for correcting Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan\n\n  * 3\n\n#####  For years, people pinned dollar bills to the ceiling of Alameda bar.\nWhy they finally took them down\n\n  * 4\n\n#####  Fodor's puts Big Sur on its do not travel list for 2020\n\n  * 5\n\n#####  BART confirms fatality aboard one of its trains\n\n  * 6\n\n#####  Trump press secretary faces backlash over claim that Obama aides left\n'you will fail' notes\n\n  * 7\n\n#####  Letter shows psychologist broke rules with Iowa sex predator\n\n  * 8\n\n#####  Man Shot While Standing In Front Of Outer Mission Home Early Tuesday\n\n  * 9\n\n#####  Here's where PG&E blackouts will start Wednesday\n\n  * 10\n\n#####  PG&E hasn't confirmed precise outage timing.

As they stepped\noutside the airport, one after the other, they appeared sad. Some said they\nfelt dejected that they could not realise their American dream even after\nseveral attempts.\n\n“This was the fourth time I have been deported,” said Singh Jabarjung, 24,\nfrom Punjab’s Bhatinda.  \n“I boarded a flight on May 15 and reached Mexico via Moscow and Paris. From\nthere, I tried to enter California on May 16 but was caught by police and\ndeported from Arizona,” he said.\n\nHe said he has spent Rs 24 lakh in the four attempts and Rs 40 lakh on\nadvocacy. Lakshiwnder Singh, another deportee, said he had given Rs 25 lakh to\nan Amritsar-based agent to help him enter the US. “He sent me to Mexico on May\n2 via Moscow and Paris. They caught me while I was trying to cross the border\nand deported here from Arizona in US,” he said.\n\nThe special aircraft carrying the deportees landed at the T3 terminal of the\nDelhi airport at 6am, an airport official said. The aircraft reached India via\nBangladesh. Following paper work with the immigration department, the\ndeportees have started coming out of the airport. These 150 Indians have\neither violated their visa norms or were illegal immigrants, the officials\nsaid.\n\nOn October 18, more than 300 Indians, including one woman, were deported by\nMexican immigration authorities for illegally entering the country to sneak\ninto the US.

It is up to them to\nde-escalate, as others should tell them\n\nMon 18 Nov 2019 18.54 GMT Last modified on Mon 18 Nov 2019 18.56 GMT\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share via Email\n\n‘Excessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these\nprotests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far\nbroader movement.’ Photograph: AFP via Getty\n\nHong Kong is burning. The authorities continue to pour fuel on the fire. On\nMonday, the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, warned that\nthere is “absolutely no room for compromise”. But it is not merely that\nBeijing and the Hong Kong government will not take a step back; they continue\nto escalate the crisis.\n\nAs the newspaper commentary was published, Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nwas besieged by police, who fired round after round of teargas at protesters\nattempting to flee the scene. The message – no way out – was all the more\ndisturbing given that officers had earlier threatened to use live fire if\npetrol bombs or weaponry were used against them again. Among the hundreds\ntrapped were said to be secondary school pupils. Parents, lawmakers and a\nbishop who sought to talk to protesters and seek some kind of resolution were\nprevented from doing so, though the former head of Hong Kong’s legislative\ncouncil was later allowed to enter. When tens of thousands more residents\nlaunched “save the students” marches converging upon the campus, they too\nfaced rubber bullets and teargas, in some cases after people threw petrol\nbombs.\n\nExcessive force and police brutality have accelerated and magnified these\nprotests, turning what began as a rejection of the extradition bill into a far\nbroader movement, and persuading a large section of the population that they\nshould support it. The withdrawal of the bill was far too little, too late.\nMeanwhile, banning most rallies has closed off a peaceful avenue for\nchallenging authorities.\n\nThough many remain peaceful, a radical minority of protesters have responded\nwith unacceptable violence. Many in Hong Kong will deplore that decision and\nwere rightly repelled when a man was set on fire last week, apparently by a\nprotester. Another man died after he was hit by a brick during a clash between\nprotesters and police. But a large proportion of the population still blames\nthose in power for this crisis, and it is likely that more stand by the cause:\ndefending Hong Kong’s way of life, safeguarded in theory until 2047, but\ndramatically eroded in recent years. Meanwhile, they note that the People’s\nLiberation Army took to the city’s streets to clear barricades this weekend: a\n“voluntary clean-up activity” which acted as a reminder that the Chinese\nmilitary could yet be called in, and which many saw as an attempt to normalise\ntheir presence.\n\nThe movement’s resolve in Hong Kong is also a response to events on the\nmainland: the increasing repression seen under Xi Jinping, most of all in\nXinjiang. As government documents leaked to the New York Times have unveiled,\nthe mass detention of a million or more Uighurs and other minorities\noriginated in directives from Xi to “show absolutely no mercy” in the\n“struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”. Many in Hong Kong\nfear that to pause or seek compromise is to surrender entirely. Further\nrepression in the region will provoke the kind of ongoing resistance, even\ninsurgency, that some have called the “Belfastisation” of the city.\n\nFurther afield, the crisis has boosted, to Beijing’s chagrin, the prospects of\nTaiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive\nparty, as she faces next year’s election. And the Hong Kong Human Rights and\nDemocracy Act, under consideration by the US Senate on Monday, would impose\neconomic sanctions and a travel ban on officials deemed responsible for human\nrights abuses.\n\nChina’s leaders may still believe all this is a price worth paying. Since\n1989, when it crushed the pro-reform protests that began in Tiananmen Square,\nand witnessed the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union, Beijing has\ncalculated that bloody suppression should be avoided if possible – but not by\noffering concessions. It will angrily dismiss any criticism, as it has that\nfrom Britain. Ignored or not, foreign leaders have a duty to remind China that\nthey are watching.\n\nTopics\n\n  * Hong Kong \n  * Opinion \n\n  * Protest \n  * Asia Pacific \n  * Communism \n  * Xi Jinping \n  * China \n  * editorials \n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share via Email\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on Pinterest\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Share on Messenger\n\n  * Reuse this content\n\n##  Most popular\n\n  * The Guardian view \n  * Columnists \n  * Cartoons \n  * Opinion videos \n  * Letters \n\n  * News \n  * Opinion \n  * Sport \n  * Culture \n  * Lifestyle \n\n  * Contact us \n  * Complaints & corrections \n  * SecureDrop \n  * Work for us \n  * Privacy policy \n  * Cookie policy \n  * Terms & conditions \n  * Help \n\n  * All topics \n  * All writers \n  * Digital newspaper archive \n  * Facebook \n  * Twitter \n\n  * Advertise with us \n  * Search UK jobs \n  * Dating \n  * Discount Codes \n\nSupport The Guardian\n\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\n\nContribute  Subscribe\n\nBack to top\n\n© 2019 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The new 16-inch\nMacBook Pro is a heck of a lot like the old 15-inch MacBook Pro, save for a\nfew meaningful throwback features. Yes, I mean throwback as in retro—as in\nApple actually took retired features from old MacBooks and reintroduced them\nas new features. It would seem that the future of innovation at the Cupertino-\nbased computer company is what I’ll call rewind design.\n\nI’m not complaining. The 16-inch MacBook Pro looks like a hell of a laptop, as\nit should for a starting price of $2,400. The new machine comes with a bigger\ndisplay, a bigger battery, better speakers, and a brand new AMD graphics card.\nThen there are those retro features. There’s a physical escape button just\nlike there was on MacBook Pros before the rise of the Touch Bar. The arrow\nkeys are once again arranged in an inverted “T” formation, as they had been on\nkeyboards for decades. The new “Magic Keyboard” uses a scissor switch that’s\nalmost identical to the Bluetooth-enabled Magic Keyboard that Apple released\nnearly five years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe keyboard thing is a big deal. Apple has been dealing with public outrage\nsparked by its newer butterfly mechanism in MacBook keyboards. This low-travel\ndesign contributed to the impossible thinness of the 12-inch MacBook released\nin 2015, before finding its way into all MacBook models in 2016. Even a small\nbit of dust or debris could disable a key, and fixing it required replacing\nthe entire upper half of the laptop. Apple admitted to the flawed design and\nlaunched a limited repair program in June 2018, before it ultimately offered\nfree keyboard repairs for all MacBooks with the new mechanism. The company was\nstill trying to fix the scissor design as recently as May of this year when it\nlaunched an updated 15-inch MacBook Pro. Now, the cursed butterfly-powered\nMacBook keyboard is all but dead. The new keyboard design is expected to show\nup on smaller MacBooks in early 2020.\n\nBut the new design isn’t all that new. As iFixit points out in its teardown,\nthe 16-inch MacBook’s keyboard is virtually identical to the well-loved Magic\nKeyboard from 2o15. In other words, Apple replaced a flawed design from\n2015—one that it had tried and failed to perfect many times—with a design from\n2015 that wasn’t so flawed. It’s almost as if Apple made the wrong decision\nalmost five years ago, and in order to deal with that, it’s just going back in\ntime and making the right decision. The same is true for the new physical\nescape button, which Apple had axed on most MacBook Pro models in 2016, and\nfor the new inverted “T” arrow key layout, which Apple had done away with back\nin 2015.\n\nPhoto: iFixit\n\nThis is a curious way to design computers. It also seems like Apple’s MacBook\nteam was really screwing up back in 2015. That was a time when the company’s\ndesign team decided to fix a few things that weren’t broken and break a few\nmore things in the process. Now, to fix those problems, Apple is just\nreplacing the broken new things with near-identical versions of the old\nthings, effectively putting its design process in reverse. If you liked the\ncrispiness and ease of the newer scissor mechanism on the big MacBook Pro, too\nbad. Apple failed at perfecting its promising design so it just switched back\nto the old one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce again, I’m not complaining. As one of the many thousands of people with\nbroken MacBook keyboards, I welcome the return of the more robust design of\nthe Magic Keyboard. I have one of the old Magic Keyboards on my desk, and I\nlove it! I especially love how the keys don’t break constantly. And while\nwe’re on the topic, I also miss having an escape key. My 15-inch MacBook Pro\nhas a Touch Bar, which I hate—although I would hate it slightly less if it had\na physical escape key. I’m honestly impartial on the inverted “T” arrow key\nthing, but I know some people are passionate about it.\n\nWhat does bug me about Apple’s new take on innovation is that it confirms the\nbelief that the company seldom has new ideas. I wrote a long rant about this\nlast year when it was apparent that Apple focuses less on hardware innovation\nand more on money-making services. That prediction, unfortunately, turned out\nto be true. In recent months, we’ve seen the release of a new iPhone, which\namounted to the old iPhone plus an extra camera, as well as the new Apple TV+\nstreaming service, which is a bit bland. They’re not bad products. But they’re\ncertainly not groundbreaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same appears to be true for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I’ll reserve final\njudgment until I’ve had time to test the new laptop, and given my penchant for\nan operational keyboard and an escape key, I bet I’ll like it. I just can’t\nstop wondering if I’ll ever see another new Apple product that warps my\nunderstanding of technology the way that the iPod or the iPhone did so many\nyears ago. It’s possible that Apple will do it with some sort of augmented\nreality headset in the next couple of years. Maybe its designers have been so\nbusy working on that futuristic product that they couldn’t focus on perfecting\nkeyboard design. Surely they’ve been busy doing better things.\n\n#### Share This Story\n\n#### Recommended Stories\n\n###\n\nYep, There's a Giant New MacBook Pro, and Yep, Apple Improved Its Keyboard\n\n###\n\nApple Finally Did the Right Thing (Sort of)\n\n###\n\nHere's a First Look at the New MacBook Pro Keyboard\n\n###\n\nApple's Future Looks Rotten\n\n###\n\nTry to Hate the iPhone 11 Pro\n\n###\n\nApple Just Gutted Its Laptop Lineup\n\n#### About the author\n\nAdam Clark Estes\n\nAdam Clark Estes\n\nSenior editor at Gizmodo.\n\nEmailTwitterPostsKeys\n\nPGP Fingerprint: 91CF B387 7B38 148C DDD6 38D2 6CBC 1E46 1DBF 22A8 • PGP Key\n\nOTR Fingerprint: D9330D9B 6CF5E271 7FAC6194 DAA9B51B E09A99B2\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\n"

Sonos Move. Galaxy Note 10. See what else made our list for best\ntech gadgets of the past year.\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nBy Jason Cipriani | November 18, 2019 -- 19:14 GMT (19:14 GMT) | Topic:\nHardware\n\n(Image: gargantiopa / Getty Images)\n\n###  Black Friday\n\nBusiness Bargain Hunter's top picks\n\nThe very best Black Friday deals and sales.\n\nRead More\n\nAs the year comes to an end, it's time to sit back and reflect. This year we\nsaw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple\nimpresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech\ncompanies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\n\n**Also:**See Black Friday coverage at CNET\n\nSurely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along\nwith the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to\nkeep on an eye out for the best deals.\n\n## **Some of 2019's best tech gadgets**\n\n **Disclosure** : _ZDNet_ may earn a commission from some of the products\nfeatured on this page.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\n### Apple AirPods Pro for $235\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nSince the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been\nasking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple\nfinally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new\ndesign sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments,\nand comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit.\n\nNintendo\n\n### Nintendo Switch Lite for $200\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nThe smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into\na dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The\nscreen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently\nattached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch\nthat users love and embrace.\n\nSonos\n\n### Sonos Move for $400\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nSonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment\nspeakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable.\nWith Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest\nof its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or\nApple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close\nthe nearest power outlet is.\n\nAmazon\n\n### Amazon Echo Buds for $130\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nIn many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have\nbeen well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds\nhave Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and\nAndroid devices.\n\nApple iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nApple, Inc.\n\n### Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max for $999\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Apple**\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what\nit did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an\namazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that\nbattery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get\nthis year.\n\nJason Cipriani/ZDNet\n\n### Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Samsung**\n\nArguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed,\nhas a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep\nup with whatever you throw at it. It has plenty of cameras to harness your\ncreativity, and, of course, it has that S-Pen that users know and love.\n\nDJI\n\n### DJI Mavic Mini for $399\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nThe Mavic Mini is the ideal combination of a capable drone in a small package.\nWith a range of up to 4km and battery life of 30 minutes, it's pretty hard to\nbelieve it's priced at $399. It's perfect for those new to drones and\nenthusiasts who love shiny new things.\n\nFossil\n\n### Fossil Hybrid HR smartwatch for $195\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Fossil**\n\nThe Fossil Hybrid HR is billed as a smartwatch, but could easily pass as a\nnormal watch. Underneath the physical watch hands is an energy-efficient\ndisplay that sips on battery yet still provides notifications from your\nconnected phone, as well as weather and calendar details.\n\nWyze\n\n### Wyze Sense Starter Kit for $20\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Wyze**\n\nKnow when a window or door opens, or whenever there's motion in the hallway\nwith the Wyze Sense starter kit. You'll need one of Wyze's security cameras to\nconnect it all to the internet, but those are just as cheap as this kit.\n\nAmazon\n\n### Amazon Echo Dot with clock for $45\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nOne of my top requests to Amazon's Alexa is to ask for the current time. The\nnew Echo Dot with a clock eliminates that by adding a small digital clock to\nthe side. You can still ask for the time, of course, or use Alexa to control\nconnected devices, ask questions or play music.\n\nRing\n\n### Ring Indoor Cam for $60\n\n  *  **See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nRing security cameras are some of the best, but up until now, they'd all been\nmade primarily for outdoor use. The new indoor camera is affordable and\ncapable of helping you monitor your home.\n\nLet's be honest, distilling down the past year's worth of gadget launches into\na shortlist is hard. Really hard. Surely, we left some of your favorite\ngadgets off of this list. Leave a comment and let us know what your favorite\ngadget of 2019 is.\n\nBest gifts for co-workers under $50 on A...

I’ve got to say,\nI’m impressed! The level of detail is superb, with very clear diagrams and\ninstruction – particularly useful are the exploded drawings which feature\nregularly, and really help you to see how things come apart (and go back\ntogether).\n\nAdvert  \n\nI was a little wary at the title of this book – described as for the\n‘CBR600F4’, this is of course the US version of the Honda I own. I needn’t\nhave worried – the UK bikes are fully covered, with all wiring diagrams and\nother areas clearly labeled for each market.\n\nWorking on your own bike can be incredibly rewarding, so besides the fact that\nthese manuals can save you a small fortune, the gratification of servicing and\nmaintaining your motorcycle make them worth every penny (and they more than\npay for themselves even with a simple oil-change).\n\nAdvert  \n\nGet Motor Cycle Monthly delivered through your letterbox every month. 12\nissues for £11.99.

The\nprotests began peacefully in June and were sparked by proposed legislation\nthat would have meant criminal suspects could be extradited to the mainland.\nAlthough the bill was withdrawn, the protests had broadened into a resistance\nmovement against the territory’s government and Beijing.\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * Hong Kong uprising: Protestors send defiant warning to China\n  * Hong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\nMany of the protesters wear masks to shield their identities for protection.\n\nChina’s ambassador to Britain accused the UK and the US of meddling in the\ncountry’s affairs and warned that the Chinese government “will not sit on our\nhands” if the Hong Kong situation “becomes uncontrollable”.\n\nCheuk Hau-yip, the commander of Kowloon West district, said: “These rioters,\nthey are also criminals.

You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of\nclimbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan\nyour next jump.\n\nIt’s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking,\ndodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it’s even Star\nWars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally\nancient tombs.\n\nWhere it’s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I\ninstead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other\ngames and presenting them in a coherent way.\n\nFallen Order’s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding\nas a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge\nof the Jedi. The game’s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the\nprequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era’s biggest moments is enough to\nget you on board with the premise.\n\nOne of the narrative’s strongest elements is that it doesn’t rely on iconic\ncharacters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan\nare briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction\ntends to bring to their appearances. There’s one exception to that towards the\nvery end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-\nexecuted, but ultimately doesn’t matter to the general story.\n\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the\nForce, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly\nadorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them\nuse Greez’s ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With\nthe exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time\nto grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in\nbleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year’s best new character.\n\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction – and my god, every\nlittle animation he plays – both of which build up his character as an\ninquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial\nrobots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2’s\nBT-7274.\n\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to\nobtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find\nsaid civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little\nbearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn’t so much\nthe need to get the _things_ , as it was to spend more time with these\nincredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways.\nTaking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will\nonly be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes\nrequire a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\n\nThis means you’ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets\neven as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn’t shy about\nsending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the\nnext, but you don’t always need to follow the quest marker if you don’t want\nto.\n\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just\nby exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that\nenemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I\nmanaged to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different\npoint through normal story progression, so it’s great to see Respawn offer\nplayers the freedom to obtain it so early.\n\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated\nmess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It’s not as elegant as you might\nfind in FromSoftware’s work, which is what makes the map – available to you at\nany point – such a lifesaver.\n\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible\nand which aren’t. They’re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked\noff require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It’s\na more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake’s map, and alleviates\nsome of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous\nlevels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems\nentirely, but one doesn’t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend\nminutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and\nwatch a cutscene.\n\nIn your adventures, you’ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The\nwildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they’re often in groups, and\nhave harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in\na single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a\nbigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers,\nhowever – units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\n\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they’re mostly armed with melee\nweapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more\nmanageable.\n\n  \n_The best new character in 2019._\n\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three\ntogether, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these\nsort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\n\nYou’re going to parry the basic trooper’s bolts back at them, killing them in\none hit. You’ll watch for the melee trooper’s very obvious tells to also get\nrid of them very quickly, and you’ll use whatever Force powers you might have\nto push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the\ncrowd. After all is said and done, you’ll be left with one or two Purge\nTroopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\n\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out\nthe power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on\nMaster), you’re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as\nyou would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone\nplaying The Force Unleashed 2019.\n\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the\nlower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would\nlove to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to\nget stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\n\nFallen Order’s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its\nown rules. You don’t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy\nessentially forever, although most enemies can block.\n\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are\nblocked. After it depletes, you’ll need to disengage until it recharges, or go\non the offensive. It’s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-\nstepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where\nit falters is the execution.\n\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through\nyour roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you’ll begin defaulting to\njust holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable,\nbut it’s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll\nthrough and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some\nconsistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\n\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time\nit right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a\nfight. There’s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you\npull one off. Your opponents’ guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment\nas a result of the parry.\n\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into\nthe blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can’t cancel into a parry.\nThis caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing\nright. By the same token, enemies don’t really care about your parries, save\nfor bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They’ll often continue their combo unabated\nand you’ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren’t\nworking.\n\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn’t fast enough to keep up\nwith enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and\nblocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I\nfound that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often\neasier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that\nwindow to attack.\n\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could’ve soured me on the game if\nForce powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn’t hook me.\n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in\ntraversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the\nlimited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the\naforementioned combat could all – at the game’s worst moments – lead to\nfrustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those\nedges, and it may get there eventually – but right now, lack of polish is\nholding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren’t enough to knock down my\nenjoyment, and I’ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to\nplayers on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident,\nfocused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don’t always win.\n\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired\nby, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting – but\nRespawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside\nthose hallowed inspirations.\n\nAnd yes, it doesn’t always get there in this one, but damn If I can’t help but\nrespect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are\nserviceable, and best moments are memorable. It’s worth experiencing by Star\nWars fans hungry for an original story that doesn’t settle for trite, and\naction game players looking for a decent – albeit flawed – combat.\n\n_Version tested: PC._\n\nSometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been\nrallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with\nmacroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.\n\nWhy is the market behaving differently from the economy?\n\n\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three\npositive indicators for growth – reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed\ndivestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-\nChina trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we\nexpect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL\nSecurities.\n\nClose\n\nExperts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a\nrecovery in the economy.\n\n## related news\n\n  * ### FIIs bullish on India, growth should start accelerating in Q2CY20, says Ridham Desai\n\n  * ### Taking Stock: Historic day on D-St! Here's what is driving the rally\n\n\"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a\nreasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak\nInstitutional Equities.\n\nA key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.\n\nThe September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of\nthe companies reported in-line or better than expected results.\n\nTax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The\nkey positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front\n(sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely\nneutral, say experts.\n\n\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate\ntax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental\nResearch at Kotak Securities.\n\nFor the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the\nconcerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\n\nBank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza\nattributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar\nSteel resolution.\n\n\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should\nbe seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in\nbidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will\nbe high now,\" said Oza.\n\nGlobal financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the\nEssar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured\nbanks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.\n\n **Near-term consolidation likely**  \n\nHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't\ngrow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as\ndistorted by a misconception.\"\n\nThe hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings\nshould not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\n\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several\nstructural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or\ninvestment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the\nhigh government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\nAn extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent\nrevival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\n\nComing back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the\nmarket and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\n\nPankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is\na stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the\nbenchmark.\n\n\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far,\nit looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.\n\nThe valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.\n\nThe Indian market’s high valuations are being supported by a combination of\nfactors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a\nChina-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's\nexpectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\n\n\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the\nmarket’s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and\nstrong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional\nEquities said.\n\n _ **Disclaimer:** The views and investment tips expressed by investment\nexperts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its\nmanagement.

While it looks quite familiar, Apple's\nnew flagship laptop moves the needle forward in a big way. We've spent the\nlast several days taking the new Pro for a spin and can say that Apple has\ndutifully listened to users' feedback this time around. Let's talk about it.  \n  \n\n  \nApple's 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nWe're not certain when Apple last issued four updates to the MacBook Pro\nwithin 18 months, or to any laptop it has ever produced. But, here we are.  \n  \nJust months after the last i9 MacBook Pro was released, Apple has unveiled its\n16-inch MacBook Pro. The surface changes aren't even obvious — the monitor is\nabout a half an inch larger on the diagonal, and you can't even tell that the\nmachine is larger than the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro design.  \n  \nInterestingly, it is actually smaller and thinner than the 2012 through 2015\nmodel. You also can't tell unless you're looking at the three together.  \n  \n\n  \n\n _Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTube_\n\n  \n  \nThere are three main configurations of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, one with a\n2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, a 2.3GHz i9 model, and a 2.4GHz i9\nconfiguration —effectively the same options as the 15-inch MacBook Pro from\nearlier in 2019. Depending on model, there are options for a AMD Radeon Pro\n5300M or 5500M. For this review, we're examining the 2.4GHz 16-inch MacBook\nPro, with 512GB of flash storage, 32GB of RAM, and the Radeon Pro 5500M. The\nretail price on this configuration is $3,299.  \n  \n\n## 16-inches instead of 15.4\n\n  \n  \nThis will matter to you a great deal, or it won't, and even before you started\nreading this, you already knew if it mattered to you or not. In our eyes,\nthere are more important aspects to the 16-inch MacBook Pro redesign than the\nscreen, though.  \n  \nWhat we will say, is if you are staring at a 15-inch MacBook Pro right next to\nthe 16-inch MacBook Pro you will notice a difference. The updated design looks\nbetter with slimmer bezels and an ever-so-slightly elevated pixel density\ngoing from 220 to 226ppi. That likely won't be a huge reason for users to\nupgrade though.  \n  \n\n  \nThe slimmer bezels of the 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nPros out there who are well-versed in the video space will appreciate one\nchange to the display though, which is the ability to specifically choose your\nrefresh rate. Heading to System Preferences, multiple options can be chosen\nfrom to best align with your work.  \n  \n\n## Keyboard\n\n  \n  \nKeyboards are highly subjective. So highly subjective, in fact, that even if\nyou like a mechanical keyboard, there are dozens of different iterations, with\ndifferent key feels because assorted manufacturers believe that there is that\nmuch granularity in demand.  \n  \nSo, a little context is important. We're not giant fans of typing on glass,\nlike the iPad. We didn't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard that was\nintroduced with the 2016 MacBook Pro — but it wasn't a favorite of ours.  \n  \n\n  \nInverted 'T' design for arrow keys\n\n  \n  \nWe get that the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard design, and iterations, are\npolarizing. Where the 2012 through 2015 design had the entire expression of\nkeyboard like and hate, the 2016 through 2019 weighed more heavily on the\n\"it'll do\" to \"this is terrible\" range, with very, very few folks in the \"this\nis great\" zone.  \n  \nIn regards to reliability, across the entire _AppleInsider_ staff, exactly one\nunit had to be replaced. We had the same failure rate with the 2012 through\n2015 keyboard. And, the data we've been collecting on the 2018 model and the\nmid-2019 refresh suggests that whatever Apple did for reliability is working,\nwith it having an equivalent failure rate in the first year to the 2012\nthrough 2015 design.  \n  \nBeyond looking back, the key actuation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is\npunctuated by a soft click, most similar to the mid-2019 noise versus any\nother, if a bit quieter. Where the 2015 design noise was more from the key\nbottoming out the switch, if you press slowly, you can feel where the click is\non the new computer, before hitting the bottom of the chamber. Gone is the\nclackety-clack of the original 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard, and you'll never\nmistake this keyboard for a desktop mechanical model.  \n  \nThere's more sensory data on the keys in the video that accompanies this\npiece. But, here are the numbers: the key travel on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nkeyboard is one millimeter. This is in comparison to between 0.6 and 0.7\nmillimeters on the 2016-style keyboard, and between 1.2 and 1.5 millimeters on\nthe 2012 through 2015 style.  \n  \n\n  \nTyping on the new MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard\n\n  \n  \nIn our testing, we had a baseline of 38 dBa of ambient noise measured with a\nKanomax model 4431 audiometer, with the test gear at head height and distance.\nTyping on the 2016 MacBook Pro with no other CPU load brought that up to about\n43 dBa. The highest we could manage on the 16-inch MacBook pro with a\nparticularly angry bout of random key-mashing was 41 dBa. Quieter indeed.  \n  \nWith that 2016 redesign, Apple made a big deal about key stability being an\nunderpinning of the design. In short, the new keyboard is more key travel than\nthe 2016, but less than the 2012. Whatever Apple did for key stability in the\n2016 was moved to the 16-inch MacBook pro — and this is a good thing.  \n  \nAnd, Apple tells us that individual keys can be replaced. We didn't get any\ninformation on what this entails, but at this juncture, it still looks like a\ncomplete disassembly is required to do so.  \n  \n\n## Touch Bar and Escape Key\n\n  \n  \nThe new keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro has a physical escape key, and\ninstead of the Touch ID sensor being connected to the Touch Bar, it is in its\nown little well. Coders have been clamoring for the former, and we think that\nApple did the latter to ease repair, if that sensor needs to be replaced.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nIn our use, a physical escape key makes little difference — but for coders,\nit's an entirely different story. We've been told about times where things\nhave gone completely awry, and the virtual escape key on the Touch Bar doesn't\nwork at all, forcing a hard reboot.  \n  \nAs a general rule, we like what the Touch Bar brings. After a lukewarm initial\nimpression. we've adopted it into our workflows. We're not going to say that\neverybody is going to like it, but utilities like Better Touch Tool open up a\nfrontier of customization options, and we recommend it to anybody that has a\nTouch Bar and wants to use it beyond the Apple-sanctioned or developer-\nmandated uses.  \n  \n\n## Testing the silicon\n\n  \n  \nApple did include the same CPU options as the mid-2019 predecessors but thanks\nto its new internals, it is able to get slightly better performance out of the\nchips. When we compared the 16-inch base to the previous 15-inch base, we saw\nthat single-core scores increased from 1061 to 1128 and multi-core scores\nincreased from 5425 to 5641 on Geekbench 5.  \n  \nIn Cinebench R20, scores jumped as well from 2395 to 2623. This is due to the\nmachine being able to keep those cores cooler for longer.  \n  \nRunning the Browserbench.org Speedometer test that measures web app\nperformance on each machine, the new machine scored a 129 while the previous\ngeneration clocked in at a 126.8.  \n  \n\n## GPU\n\n  \n  \nFor the GPU, we turned once more to our usual Unigine Heaven benchmark.\nRunning at full screen, with tesselation and stereo turned off, at medium\nquality (our standard settings), the new machine earned an average of 86.6\nframes per second and a 2182 score. It maxed out at an impressive 162.1 frames\nper second.  \n  \n\n  \nUnigine Heaven benchmark results for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nImpressively, that beats the VEGA 20 graphics from the previous design which\nearned a total score of 2072 and a max FPS of 147.4. It also won on average\nFPS over the previous 82.3. Again, that is our base model compared to the\nprevious high-end selection.  \n  \nIn another benchmark to test the performance of Metal, we ran the Geekbench 5\nCompute test. The new base machine managed a 21757 while the previous base\ngarnered only a 13919.  \n  \nLastly, we performed an export test. Exporting the same 4K 24FPS Final Cut Pro\nX project from both base units with the same settings. Final Cut was updated\nThe previous generation took 4 minutes and 15 seconds while the updated\nmachine did the export in only 2 minutes and 38 seconds.  \n  \n\n## Thermals\n\n  \n  \nThe 2018 15-inch i9 MacBook Pro was a very hot machine. While it still holds\nup, Apple has improved the situation greatly with the 16-inch MacBook pro.  \n  \nEight cores are hot. The 5500M chipset is toasty, and the RAM is too.  \n  \nIn our use, when the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro was under load, the keyboard's metal\nsurface routinely hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit around the G, H, and J keys.\nThat's still usable, but it is very, very warm. On the new 16-inch MacBook\nPro, that area is still the hotspot, but it hit a maximum of 89 degrees while\nrunning under load.  \n  \nThere are still a large number of picky details to examine with the 16-inch\nMacBook Pro in regards to the thermal environment. We'll be looking a lot more\nat varying work environments including ambient temperature effects, and\nmachine orientations as the weeks and months wear on to see if they make any\ndifference at all to performance.  \n  \n\n  \n  \nBut, we're not expecting to see much difference this time around.  \n  \nIn regards to the revamped cooling system. Apple says that the 16-inch MacBook\nPro has different fan blades and more surface area on all heat exchanging\nsurfaces. This means that the computer sounds different under load.  \n  \nStrictly from a noise standpoint, in the same 38 dBA room, the 2016 MacBook\nPro under heavy load is about 45 dBa at the same range that we did the\nkeyboard testing. The 16-inch MacBook Pro hit a maximum of 44 dBa, with\nequivalent fan speeds to the 2016 model.  \n  \nThe MacBook Pro for the last seven years has sounded about the same. It's hard\nto describe how it sounds now, but there's a lower pitch and a different\nwarble to the fans now, likely because of the new blade shape. You'll notice\nthe difference if you're a long-time user, but it isn't distracting, and\nyou'll forget the old sound pretty quickly.  \n  \n\n  \nUsing Final Cut Pro X on the new MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nWe've only just started testing and thermal performance. Our initial testing\nsuggests that the 16-inch MacBook Pro can maintain a higher clock speed for\nlonger — which isn't well-reflected in benchmark testing to date.  \n  \nThe fans on the new MacBook Pro start to get audible in that 38 dBa office\nenvironment at about 83 degrees Celsius processor temperature. Based on\nobservation, they start to pick up speed at about 75C — earlier than the 80C\nthat the 2016 through 2019 MacBook Pro start to ramp up. We'll be testing this\nmore in the future.  \n  \nThe efficacy of this thermal redesign in regards to your own workflow will\nvary very much depending on your individual workload. But, using a utility\nthat turns off the boost feature on the processor essentially guarantees a\nsilent machine with next to no fan noise, at a cost of taking about one and a\nhalf times longer to complete your job. We'll be talking about this in the\nfuture too.  \n  \n\n## Flash speeds are still blistering\n\n  \n  \nThe drive is absolutely no slouch. Running the BlackMagic disk speed test\nafter the machine had been indexing for two days, we saw a write speed of 2890\nmegabytes per second, and a read speed of 3150 megabytes per second on both a\n512GB and 1TB model.  \n  \nThis is a bit faster than the i9 MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019, and about\n350MB per second faster than the 2018 MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage or\nmore.  \n  \n\n## Battery life\n\n  \n  \n\n  \nBattery is improved on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nThis time Apple baked in a new 100Wh battery that is necessary for the beefed-\nup internals. That new battery doesn't just match the last model's\nperformance, it extends it. While we didn't have too much of a chance to surf\nthe web for 11 hours on end, Apple says that is what you can expect — which is\none hour more than the 15-inch offered.  \n  \n\n## Speakers\n\n  \n  \nWe didn't expect much change when it came to speakers, but after trying them\nout we were wowed.  \n  \n\n  \n  \nMoving between listening to our above test playlist reserved for speakers and\nheadphones as well as Apple TV+ content with Dolby Atmos, it makes listening\nto content on a portable machine far more enjoyable.  \n  \n\n  \nThere are six speakers in the new MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nBass was substantial, but thanks to the dual force-canceling drivers, it\ndoesn't cause the machine to shake or feel uncomfortable at loud volumes.  \n  \nThe biggest note was how much larger and fuller the soundstage appeared as we\nlistening to content from one machine to the other.  \n  \n\n## Wi-Fi 6\n\n  \n  \nOddly, Apple has a few omissions with the pro machine. The FaceTime camera is\nstill capped at a meager 720p. But more frustrating, Apple has felt the need\nto hold back with 801.11ac Wi-Fi rather than jump to Wi-Fi 6 ax as we saw with\nthe most recent iPhone launch.  \n  \nConsidering a Mac is intended to be a portable machine, the lack of the latest\nWi-Fi tech is frustrating. Users rightly expect to pick up a Mac and use it\nfor several years and investing in a new machine shouldn't be capped by\nprevious standards. Especially one Apple has already adopted en masse with\nmillions of iPhones.  \n  \nWi-Fi 6 is still launching and there is only a smattering of ax routers on the\nmarket so looking at today's landscape users aren't missing out, but they will\nwhen they have this machine in two-three years and Wi-Fi 6 has been more\nwidely adopted.  \n  \nThere will certainly be some iPhone 11 Pro users who will jump on board with\nWi-Fi 6 early to take advantage of it on their phones that will be left behind\nwith the new MacBook Pro in that regard.  \n  \n\n## Still four Thunderbolt 3\n\n  \n  \nApple has now redesigned the MacBook Pro, listening to pro users, and the HDMI\nport has not returned. Thunderbolt 3 is staying. It's past time to come to\nterms and deal with it.  \n  \n\n  \nStill four Thunderbolt 3 ports\n\n  \n  \nThe USB-C physical connector on Thunderbolt 3 is not the end of the world, but\nit is an adjustment for users, if you're coming from a 2015 or older MacBook\nPro. Complaints that there are multiple flavors of USB-C are correct, but this\nis more of an issue with cable labeling than anything else. That adjustment is\nbetter made, than tolerated using half-baked solutions.  \n  \nWe've said this before, many times: there is no special hardware required to\nconnect a HDMI or DVI monitor. Given that the Thunderbolt 3 protocol\nexplicitly contains the HDMI protocol, a cable will do, or a dongle if you\nprefer. There is no breakout box needed for USB-A connectors, and a peripheral\ncable or dongle there can be had too, depending on what you need.  \n  \nFortunately, since you have Thunderbolt 3, and not the other varieties of\nUSB-C, cables are cheap, and plentiful. You _can_ get there from here, and it\nisn't expensive to do so.  \n  \n\n  \n16-inch MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nLike we've been saying for nearly four years now, if you're hell-bent on\nsticking with your existing cabling instead of adopting cables with a USB-C\nend is choosing from one of many a Thunderbolt dock. Thunderbolt 3 docks start\nat $199 retail, and USB 3.2 type C ones can be had for cheaper than that, if\nyou don't need the full 40 gigabits per second that the faster protocol\nallows.  \n  \nIn our testing, with a two-hour load on the MacBook Pro using both the CPU and\nGPU, an 87W Thunderbolt 3 dock or power adapter still drained the battery to\nthe tune of about 4% per hour. Under \"normal\" office use or similar work there\nwas no drain at all.  \n  \nIf you have an older Thunderbolt dock from your 2012 or later Retina MacBook\nPro, the $49 Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will connect that\nunit to the new machine. It won't supply power, but, fortunately, the 96W\nadapter that your machine came with will.  \n  \nFurthermore, if you're considering an external GPU, many of the enclosures\nhave USB-A and Ethernet ports, in an accessory that costs not much more than a\ndock does. If all you need are a few USB-A ports, get a USB 3.0 dock, along\nwith a USB-C to USB-B cable for around $8. Problem solved. Nothing that we've\nseen presently for eGPU enclosures provides 96W, but that will likely be\nrectified very soon.  \n  \nRegarding MagSafe, we've been testing USB-C for a very, very long time at this\npoint, and our results are unchanged. On a melamine, Corian, or finished wood\ndesk surface, the force required to pull out Apple's USB-C charging cable is\nabout three-quarters of what it takes to break a MagSafe 2 connection, when\nthe cable is pulled from less than a 40-degree angle from center on the\nhorizontal plane, and less than 30 degrees from center on the vertical.  \n  \n\n  \nThe 96W USB-C power adapter\n\n  \n  \nAnd, the AC adapter also has a USB-C connector with the same disconnect force,\nso now there are two rapid breakpoints in the case of an accident or\ninadvertent pull.  \n  \nApple's service numbers that we've collated bear out that the removal of\nofficial MagSafe hasn't caused any notable increase in incidents. MagSafe's\nintroduction in January 2006 halved accidental damage service calls by 2009.\nThere was no change in those numbers for MagSafe 2. But, in the three years\nsince the MacBook Pro was released, there has been no increase in the\naccidental damage rate from a reported cable snag at all.  \n  \nWith a 11-hour battery, we're not sure why you'd want to string a power cord\nalong a transit route anyway. If you're that concerned about it, buy a USB-PD\nbattery and keep it next to your computer.  \n  \nIf you're still not happy that MagSafe is gone, there are inexpensive options\non Amazon.  \n  \n\n## The MacBook Pro is a workhorse, but is not a desktop\n\n  \n  \nThe MacBook Pro is not going to be the same maximum speed as the Mac Pro. It\nisn't even going to top the iMac Pro in every regard. But, it is portable, and\nit is very, very fast.  \n  \nIf you're doing long runs of rendering or the like, the iMac Pro will work\nbetter for you. Despite some social media posts to the contrary, the iMac Pro\nis in no way a portable machine. While the new Mac Pro doesn't have those\nseemingly sharpened handles that the old-school Mac Pro did, it isn't really\nportable either, even if you spring for the wheels.  \n  \nAs the last two i9 MacBook Pro were, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a solid\nmachine, one that is faster than literally every other MacBook Pro ever made,\nif not by a lot.  \n  \nNo matter how much of a Pro you are, not everything is a long processing job,\nconstantly slamming the processor. Even most editing tasks aren't constantly\npushing your CPU and GPU to the absolute limits. As we've said time and time\nagain, considering your own workflow in regards to what you do most of the\ntime is crucial in making this decision.  \n  \n\n  \nEditing in the Final Cut Pro X on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nIf you're coming from a 2018 or earlier MacBook Pro, including the i9 2018\nMacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with either flavor of i9 processor is\nunquestionably a great choice. However, the real-world performance for nearly\nevery task that you will do, minus those blue-moon processor-crushing ones,\nthe i9 performance isn't supremely higher than that of the i7 \"baseline\"\nmodel.  \n  \nAs with every other i9 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a lot of\ncomputer, with a lot of power, for a lot of money. There are cheaper machines\nwith the i9, dealing with many of the same thermal constraints, running\nWindows.  \n  \nHow much is macOS worth to you? You can say all you want that there are\ncheaper Windows options, and you'll be right. But, none of them bring macOS to\nthe table.  \n  \nAs it was before, and as it remains, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an i9\nprocessor is the right tool for macOS jobs that demand portability. It is not\nthe ultimate solution to every macOS-centric computing problem, and those\npeople that need that solution probably already know that they need to wait\nfor the Mac Pro tower.  \n  \n\n## Score 4.5 out of 5\n\n  \n  \n\n## Save hundreds on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\n  \n  \nApple resellers are accepting orders for the **new 16-inch MacBook Pro** with\na variety of incentives. **Expercom** is knocking up to $438 off select new\nconfigurations with coupon code **appleinsider** , while **Adorama** is taking\nup to $250 off retail models with promo code **APINSIDER** (prices start at\njust $2,199 with code). Details can be found in this 16-inch MacBook Pro deal\nroundup.  \n  \nMeanwhile, at B&H, shoppers can **save $100** on the retail systems and select\nbetween no interest financing when paid in full within 12 months with the B&H\nFinancing Card or a sales tax refund in eligible states with its Payboo Credit\nCard.

Glass was 20-of-24 passing\nfor 235 yards.\n\nThe Eagles led 14-7 at halftime before scoring 24 points in the third quarter\nfor a 38-10 bulge.\n\nHuskies quarterback Marcus Childers was intercepted three times and lost a\nfumble. Tre Harbison rushed for 112 yards on 30 carries for NIU.\n\nThe three previous games between these programs went to overtime.\n\n### **Extra points**\n\nThe status of quarterback Tanner Morgan is uncertain for Minnesota’s game at\nNorthwestern after back-to-back sacks in the last game put the sophomore in\nthe concussion protocol.\n\nCoach P.J. Fleck said Morgan has made progress this week, but the Big Ten’s\nleading passer has not been cleared. The Gophers (9-1, 6-1) play Saturday\nagainst the Wildcats (2-8, 0-7), with a one-game lead in the West Division on\nWisconsin.\n\nMorgan could be a game-time decision. If he doesn’t play, either Jacob Clark\nor Cole Kramer would start. They’re both true freshmen that Fleck would prefer\nto keep at the four-game limit to preserve their redshirt status.\n\n... Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford said he received death threats on\nsocial media after the Nittany Lions’ Nov. 9 loss at Minnesota.\n\n... Vanderbilt athletic director Malcolm Turner said Derek Mason has his full\nsupport as the Commodores coach and they’ll be working together to give the\nfootball program the resources and support needed to succeed.\n\nPublished 11:11 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n\n© The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper\n\n"

Is the service the\nfirst step towards the future of gaming, or will Stadia fall flat on its face?\nHere's what the early reviews say:\n\n####  \n**What Does Stadia Offer?**\n\n> Stadia is Google's attempt to make cloud gaming happen, and the company has\n> promised a lot: the ability to play basically any game at up to 4K on your\n> TV, phone, tablet or laptop, with no lag and on existing internet\n> infrastructure. And, based on these broad qualifiers, Stadia delivers.\n\n**[** **Engadget** **]**\n\n> Stadia isn't a console. It's a platform for streaming games from the cloud.\n> You can play Stadia titles on a TV, on a computer or on a smartphone,\n> although there are limitations on all of these categories, as I'll discuss\n> later. You buy whichever game you want to play from Google, then stream it\n> right away. There's no initial download, no patching and no buffering — just\n> instantaneous gameplay.\n\n**[** **Tom's Guide** **]**  \n\n####  \n**Stadia Is Essentially A Beta Version Until 2020, But The Price Tag Isn't\nCheap**\n\n> Come November 19, those who anted up $129 for the Google Stadia Founder's\n> Edition or functionally identical Premiere Edition will receive a Stadia\n> controller, a 4K-ready Chromecast Ultra, and three months of the $10-a-month\n> Stadia Pro subscription. This is the only way to get access to Stadia right\n> now and for the foreseeable future.\n>\n> And there's a reason for that: It's the only use case that feels finished.\n> Google Stadia arrives with a litany of missing features, especially on PC\n> and phones. As such, the Chromecast is the only device that supports 4K\n> streaming at release, as well as 5.1 surround sound and the wireless Stadia\n> controller. Those features won't hit other platforms until 2020.\n\n**[** **PC World** **]**\n\n> Stadia's launch day is Tuesday… sort of. Really, consider this the start of\n> Stadia's early-access beta period. Because Google's big promises haven't\n> arrived, and at the price of the Stadia's Founder's Edition, I can't\n> recommend anyone jump onboard at the moment. Google's experimental game\n> streaming service, Stadia, launches without many of its promised features,\n> and just a handful of games. It works, but there's not much incentive to buy\n> in.\n\n**[** **CNET** **]**  \n\n**Despite The Monthly Fee, You're Still Buying — Not Renting — Games**\n\n> While you've probably heard predictions that Google's Stadia will be the\n> \"Netflix of games,\" it turns out the analogy only goes so far. While Google\n> intends to eventually have a back catalog of free games included for your\n> $10 monthly fee, Stadia is not primarily a subscription service. The\n> subscription only includes a single game as of today — Destiny 2. Primarily,\n> Google tells us you should expect to buy, not rent cloud games for the same\n> retail prices you'd find on other platforms like PlayStation Network, Xbox\n> Live, and Steam.\n\n**[** **The Verge** **]**\n\n> Even when Stadia is at its best though, there's a catch: You will never own\n> your Stadia games. You will never have local copies on your hardware, which\n> means you have access to your games (games you paid for) only as long as\n> they stay in the Stadia library. If Google decides to remove certain titles,\n> or shutter the service entirely (it happens, pretty often in fact), the\n> games you paid for will be gone.\n\n**[** **Wired** **]**  \n\n####  \n**Stadia's Current Roster Of Games Isn't Very Impressive**\n\n> Stadia's 22 launch titles are uninspiring. They include: _Assassin's Creed\n> Odyssey_ , _Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2_ , _Destiny 2: The Collection_ ,\n> _Farming Simulator 2019_ , _Final Fantasy XV_ , _Football Manager 2020_ ,\n> _Grid 2019_ , _Gylt_ , _Just Dance 2020_ , _Kine_ , _Metro Exodus_ , _Mortal\n> Kombat 11_ , _NBA 2K20_ , _Rage 2_ , _Red Dead Redemption 2_ , _Rise of the\n> Tomb Raider_ , _Samurai Shodown_ , _Thumper_ , _Shadow of the Tomb Raider_ ,\n> _Tomb Raider 2013_ , _Trials Rising_ , and _Wolfenstein: Youngblood_. About\n> half came out this year, one is a Stadia exclusive ( _Gylt_ ), and almost\n> all of them are available on other platforms.\n\n**[** **Inverse** **]**  \n\n####  \n**Provided You Have A Solid Internet Connection, The Streaming Quality Seems\nTo Be Mostly Excellent**\n\n> Stadia's performance is promising at worst, and impressive at best. Sitting\n> in my bedroom, controller in hand, streaming Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4K\n> resolution, HDR color and 5.1 surround sound without a console anywhere in\n> sight, I couldn't help but feel a little astounded. If this is the future of\n> gaming, I could get used to it, at least on some level.\n\n**[** **Tom's Guide** **]**\n\n> The bulk of my time on the Stadia was spent with the system in traditional\n> TV mode. That means the Stadia controller connecting to Google's servers\n> over wifi, and a Chromecast Ultra plugged into the back of my TV doing the\n> same. For \"best performance\", Google recommends wiring the Chromecast up to\n> a LAN, but doing so felt like overkill. Only once did I experience anything\n> that looked like lag (when sending a picture message to my partner); every\n> other time, it was perfect.\n\n**[** **The Guardian** **]**\n\n> I have very fast internet connection at home, so the games were really crisp\n> and fluid most of the time. It felt, generally, like I was playing on a\n> regular console. But every now and again, I'd be reminded I was streaming\n> when the graphics in a game dropped to a lower quality, or if the game just\n> unexpectedly quit. That doesn't happen often on an Xbox or a PS4, and it's\n> bad news if you're trying to finish a level or fight someone in a\n> multiplayer game.\n\n**[** **CNBC]**\n\n####  \n**The Stadia Controller Is Only Necessary For Playing On A TV, But It's Very\nComfortable**\n\n> Google's gone way over the top comparing the controller to a chef's knife,\n> but it's an excellent controller, seriously. It feels something like a blend\n> of the XBox One controller and Nintendo Switch pro controller, with smooth\n> analog triggers, solid rumble haptics, crisp analog sticks and d-pad.\n> Playing with it feels effortless. I like how the Stadia button turns the\n> platform on, and a solid rumble-throb kicks in to let you know the service\n> has connected.\n\n**[** **CNET** **]**\n\n> The controller is really comfortable to hold over long periods of time and\n> has good battery life. That's important, since it's the only way to control\n> the games you're playing. The button layout is different, but it was just as\n> comfortable and really similar to the Nintendo Switch Pro controller. Setup\n> between devices was usually pretty easy. I just turned the controller on and\n> plugged it into either the Pixel 3a or computer I was using. Google says the\n> controller will eventually work wirelessly with phones as it does with the\n> Chromecast Ultra.\n\n**[** **CNBC** **]**\n\n####  \n**TL;DR**\n\n> There's no reason anyone should buy into Stadia right now. Google has made\n> sure of that, partly by underdelivering at launch and partly with a pricing\n> scheme that sees you paying three times (for hardware, for the service, for\n> games) just to be an early adopter.\n\n**[** **The Verge** **]**\n\n> Is Google Stadia the future? That's really two questions, I guess. First,\n> \"Is streaming the future of gaming?\" Possibly. It's convenient, and even\n> exciting at times. But if you're asking whether Stadia is the platform to\n> get us there? I have my doubts.\n\n**[** **PC World** **]**\n\n> Game streaming is finally viable, and Stadia is leading the charge — but\n> with this launch, it's turning out to be more of a stroll. Hey, at least\n> we're getting there.\n\n**[** **Engadget** **]**\n\n> If you're on the fence about investing $129 in an unproven service, you're\n> not alone. The Premiere Edition is basically for true believers who don't\n> mind dropping serious money on what amounts to a pay-to-play beta test. When\n> February rolls around and those free trials are offered, you should give it\n> a shot. You might be surprised.\n\n**[** **Wired** **]**  \n\nDallas Robinson is a freelance writer living in Minneapolis\n\n### Want more stories like this?\n\nEvery day we send an email with the top stories from Digg.\n\nSubscribe\n\nREINDEER GAMES\n\n#  'Why Don't You Go Fight For The Reindeer?'\n\n1 digg  delacortereview.org Long Reads World\n\nScandinavia's Sami have been herding reindeer for generations.

Retherford/SWRI)\n\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed\nseem to be real.\n\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such _plumes\nemanating from Europa_, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath\nits ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor\ndirectly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\n\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus\nand sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are\nfound all over _the solar system_. But the third — liquid water — is somewhat\nhard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary\nscientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and\nAmerican University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the\nnext best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\n\n **Related:** _ **Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images**_\n\nPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study\nthe 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as\none of the solar system's _best bets to host alien life_.\n\nThe researchers observed _Europa_ for 17 nights, from February 2016 through\nMay 2017. On one of those nights — April 26, 2016 — they got a strong signal\nof water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared\nlight.\n\nAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff — about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons),\naccording to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an\nOlympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric\ntons, of water).\n\nThe researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be\ncoming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's\nshell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted\nto result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules\nfrom Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such\nstripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be\nnoted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in _the new\npaper_, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature\nAstronomy.\n\nMultiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For\nexample, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic\nhydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by\nradiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe _measured a big increase_ in the\ndensity of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\n\nAnd it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In\nthat regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the\nsouth pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon _Enceladus_, which is\ngenerated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\n\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct\ndetection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits\nof our detection method,\" Paganini said.\n\nPlumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to\nastrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially\nhabitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic\nprobes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just\nthat, if everything works out just right.\n\nNASA is developing a mission called _Europa Clipper_, which is scheduled to\nlaunch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close\non dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for\nspots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future.\nClipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys,\nif mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years —\nor if they just get really lucky.\n\n  * _NASA Europa Mission Could Potentially Spot Signs of Alien Life_\n  *  _Photos: Europa, Mysterious Icy Moon of Jupiter_\n  *  _Keck Observatory: Twin Telescopes on Mauna Kea_\n\n _Mike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \"_ _ _Out There__ _\"\n(Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by_ __Karl Tate__ _), is out now.\nFollow him on Twitter_ _ _@michaeldwall__ _.

As a defense, the Browns had 11 hits on **Mason Rudolph** (well, 12 if you count the helmet hit). 8 of those hits came from the defensive line. 5 of those hits were from two players facing suspension now (2 for **Larry Ogunjobi**, 3 for **Myles Garrett**).\n  * Ogunjobi and Garrett have been playing a ton of snaps all season. Since **Olivier Vernon’s** injury a couple of weeks ago, **Chad Thomas** has filled in and played way above my expectations (including logging another sack this week and almost having an interception). The problem is that Cleveland really doesn’t have a long-term option to replace those snaps in the starting lineup.\n  * Ideally, Vernon would come back from his knee injury this week, but when he’ll return is still a question mark. Is veteran **Chris Smith** going to get most of Garrett’s snaps (actually, Thomas would shift over)? Smith is good for depth, but as a starter, that’s a hefty downgrade. The same goes for Ogunjobi up front. **Sheldon Richardson** is the only starter in tact right now; I’d expect some works for this week’s game in Miami.\n\n### Linebacker\n\nPos | Player | Plays | % | Stats  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nPos | Player | Plays | % | Stats  \nLB | Joe Schobert | 74 | 100% | 7 tackles, 3 assists (10 combined). 1 sack, 2\nTFL, 2 QH, 2 INT, 4 passes defended.  \nLB | Mack Wilson | 74 | 100% | 1 tackle, 4 assists (5 combined). 1 pass\ndefended.  \nLB | Sione Takitaki | 6 | 8% | No stats registered.  \n  \n  * This was an amazing game for **Joe Schobert**, who filled up the stat sheet in impressive fashion. Take a look at what PFF said about his performance:\n\n> The #Browns highest-graded player* on defense vs. #Steelers was Joe\n> Schobert. He posted an elite 93.2 defensive grade and 91.4 coverage grade.\n> He had two INTs and a PBU in coverage, allowing a passer rating of just 22.4  \n>  \n> *min. 25 snaps pic.twitter.com/PQqbN51wBW\n>\n> — PFF CLE Browns (@PFF_Browns) November 15, 2019\n\n  * **Sione Takitaki** played 6 snaps on defense, staying ahead of **Adarius Taylor** on the depth chart.\n\n### Cornerback\n\nPos | Player | Plays | % | Stats  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nPos | Player | Plays | % | Stats  \nCB | Denzel Ward | 74 | 100% | 4 tackles (4 combined). 1 pass defended.  \nCB | Greedy Williams | 73 | 99% | 6 tackles, 1 assist (7 combined). 1 TFL.  \nCB | T.J. Carrie | 63 | 85% | 1 tackle (1 combined).  \nCB | Tavierre Thomas | 1 | 1% | No stats registered.  \n  \n  * He may not have been flagged a lot, so the stat sheet won’t show it, but this was a pretty rough game for **Greedy Williams**. The Steelers had no offensive players (with experience) left, so they wisely took the approach of chucking the ball down the sideline and hoping for a catch or interference. Williams was flagged once for it, but was borderline on a few other plays, and against better receivers, would have allowed the big catches. He needs to get his head snapped around more on those plays to locate the ball. On the bright side, his run defense has been great.\n\n> #Browns Greedy Williams has been solid in run support and tackling so far\n> this season. He averages one miss for every 22 tackle attempts (T-15th) and\n> is top-20 in both run defense (75.5) and tackling grade (77.4) among 127\n> qualifying CBs pic.twitter.com/I8NWz4blQC\n>\n> — PFF CLE Browns (@PFF_Browns) November 16, 2019\n\n  * **Denzel Ward** is still waiting for his first interception of the year. He almost had one against Pittsburgh, but the overthrown pass went off his hands.\n\n### Safety\n\nPos | Player | Plays | % | Stats  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nPos | Player | Plays | % | Stats  \nS | Damarious Randall | 43 | 58% | 1 tackle (1 combined).  \nS | Juston Burris | 42 | 57% | 4 tackles, 1 assist (5 combined). 1 sack, 1 QH,\n1 INT, 1 pass defended, 1 FF.  \nS | Morgan Burnett | 35 | 47% | 3 tackles, 2 assists (5 combined). 1 TFL, 1\nINT, 2 passes defended.  \nS | Sheldrick Redwine | 33 | 45% | 1 tackle (1 combined).  \n  \n  * The safety depth was tested against the Steelers, as **Damarious Randall** was ejected mid-way through the game for a hit to the head, and **Morgan Burnett** was lost to a season-ending Achilles’ injury. Safety depth has been shaky all season due to injury, and whatever that **Jermaine Whitehead** experiment was.\n  * **Juston Burris** and **Sheldrick Redwine** both stepped up to the plate and did a good job. But that was against **Mason Rudolph** , a below average quarterback. Fortunately, Randall will be back, and Burnett was never viewed as a long-term answer at strong safety. I don’t know what direction **Steve Wilks** will go at strong safety, but I like the way Burris has played when given opportunities. When **Eric Murray** returns from injury, it’ll probably be his starting job the rest of the way.\n\n##  More From Dawgs By Nature\n\n  * Daily Dawg Chow (11/20/19)\n  * Steelers’ Mike Tomlin admits club’s role in Helmetgate\n  * The Dawgs By Nature Browns FanShop\n  * NFL Power Rankings: Browns edging closer to Steelers heading into Week 12\n  * Browns place Morgan Burnett on injured reserve\n  * Playoff Watch 2.0 – Where do the Browns stand?\n\n###  Most Read\n\n  1.

His sentencing is\nscheduled for Feb. 14, according to the office release.\n\nU.S. Attorney James Kennedy Jr. said in the release this case demonstrates\nthat free speech does not protect people to “make threats to harm lawmakers\nsimply because they may disagree with them.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSonya A. Zoghlin, Carlineo’s attorney, told The Hill in a statement that her\nclient did not intend to cause harm to Omar and did not make plans to do so.\n\n“Pat Carlineo is passionate about his political beliefs and his right to\nexpress them,” she said in an email. “He has taken responsibility for using\nthreatening and inappropriate language to express those beliefs in this\ninstance.”\n\nCarlineo was arrested in April for a March 21 phone call he reportedly made to\nOmar’s office, in which he said he’d put a “bullet in her f---ing skull.”\n\nThe office referred the call to U.S. Capitol Police, who worked with the FBI\nto investigate.

In a dramatic public retelling in the Cabinet Room, he said\nhe pressed his team to more than triple that figure, then trimmed that a\nlittle and asked for up to $50 billion in annual purchases.\n\n“My people had $20 billion done,” Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21 cabinet\nmeeting. “And I said, ‘I want more.’ They said, ‘The farmers can’t handle it.’\nI said, ‘Tell them to buy larger tractors. It’s very simple.’” The cabinet\nmembers gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.\n\nMr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks\nwith China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has\nalternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of\nthe insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even\nbigger threats should China not accede to his terms.\n\nBut more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history,\nMr. Trump’s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for.\nInstead, the president’s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even\nharder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic\nuncertainty across the globe.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had\nreached a “historic” Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has\nproved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an\nagreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr.\nTrump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal\nand if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be\nremoved.\n\n“We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,” Mr. Trump\nsaid on Nov. 8. “I like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much\nmore than I do, but we could have a deal.”\n\nA prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows\nhim to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic\ncriticism that he is caving to Beijing.\n\nBut businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged\nfinancial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms\nthat rely on robust trade flows between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nExecutives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some\nhiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by\nunforeseen policies, and conserve cash.\n\nThe uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly\nmanufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese\neconomic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while\nGermany has barely avoided falling into recession.\n\n“It’s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions\nare threatening to put the brakes on growth,” John Williams, the president of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. “The\nuncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on\nthe economic conditions we’re experiencing today.”\n\nMr. Trump’s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected\nsimilar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe, Japan,\nCanada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he\nmight leave some trading partners behind.\n\nThe president says his approach has created leverage — and in some cases, he\nis right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada,\nJapan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed\nto. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the\nUnited States, to the negotiating table.\n\nBut that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a\nclose. Mr. Trump’s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China\nwary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people\nfamiliar with Chinese trade policy said.\n\nEswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president’s “mercurial\ntemperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team” had\ncomplicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. “By hyping up\nexpectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes\nthe prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and\nvolatile,” he said.\n\nThe two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and\nhis Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of\ndomestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take\nplace in United States “farm country,” but the Chinese have been reluctant to\ncommit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\n\nWithout a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure\nto get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president’s\nunpredictable behavior — as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-\nprofile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.\nThey fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they\nanticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people\nfamiliar with their thinking.\n\nMr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the\nonly president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and\nthat the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China\nhas long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump’s efforts\nto remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged\nAmerican firms operating in China.\n\nBut they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated\ntensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack\nof resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the\nadministration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and\nleaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its\nindustry, for later talks.\n\nThe roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on\ncertainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of\nproducts that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China\ntrade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the\nTrump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of\ngoods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect — or\nwhether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would\nremain.\n\n“It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,” said Phil Levy,\nthe chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for\ncompanies. “It really doesn’t fit well with the world of global supply chains.\nAnd we’re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.\n**”**\n\nEven Mr. Trump’s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration\nwith his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the\npresident doesn’t want the show to end.\n\nIn a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the\nAmerican Farm Bureau, said farmers faced “near-unprecedented economic\nuncertainty and hardship” stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and\nother key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible,\nsaying “time is running out for many in agriculture.”\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal,\nincluding securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month.\nAmerican negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the\nmassive purchases Mr. Trump requested — larger purchases “than any time in our\nhistory, by far” — into the actual text of a trade agreement.\n\nWhile China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork,\nit has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it\nfavors American products over other countries’, as well as agreements that\ncould result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\n\nEven if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy\nand genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the\ncalculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could\nincrease its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a\nyear, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\n\nMr. Trump’s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his\nadministration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies\nwill be removed if a deal is reached.\n\nThe president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval\nOffice with Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an\nincrease in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back\nany levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been\nunder pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United\nStates.\n\n“Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not\nraising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive\nof implementing this deal on the Chinese part?” He Jianxiong, the former\nexecutive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a\nNov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.\n\nKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n## Site Index\n\nGo to Home Page »\n\nnews\n\n  * home page\n  * world\n  * U.S.\n  * politics\n  * Election 2020\n  * New York\n  * business\n  * tech\n  * science\n  * climate\n  * sports\n  * obituaries\n  * the upshot\n  * Español\n  * 中文网\n  * today's paper\n  * corrections\n\nopinion\n\n  * today's opinion\n  * op-ed columnists\n  * editorials\n  * op-ed Contributors\n  * letters\n  * sunday review\n  * video: opinion\n\narts\n\n  * today's arts\n  * art & design\n  * books\n  * dance\n  * movies\n  * music\n  * Pop Culture\n  * television\n  * theater\n  * watching\n  * video: arts\n\nliving\n\n  * automobiles\n  * Cooking\n  * crossword\n  * education\n  * food\n  * health\n  * jobs\n  * magazine\n  * parenting\n  * real estate\n  * style\n  * t magazine\n  * travel\n  * love\n\nlistings & more\n\n  * Reader Center\n  * Wirecutter\n  * Live Events\n  * The Learning Network\n  * tools & services\n  * N.Y.C. events guide\n  * multimedia\n  * photography\n  * video\n  * Newsletters\n  * NYT store\n  * times journeys\n  * manage my account\n\n### news\n\n  * home page\n  * world\n  * U.S.\n  * politics\n  * Election 2020\n  * New York\n  * business\n  * tech\n  * science\n  * climate\n  * sports\n  * obituaries\n  * the upshot\n  * Español\n  * 中文网\n  * today's paper\n  * corrections\n\n### opinion\n\n  * today's opinion\n  * op-ed columnists\n  * editorials\n  * op-ed Contributors\n  * letters\n  * sunday review\n  * video: opinion\n\n### arts\n\n  * today's arts\n  * art & design\n  * books\n  * dance\n  * movies\n  * music\n  * Pop Culture\n  * television\n  * theater\n  * watching\n  * video: arts\n\n### living\n\n  * automobiles\n  * Cooking\n  * crossword\n  * education\n  * food\n  * health\n  * jobs\n  * magazine\n  * parenting\n  * real estate\n  * style\n  * t magazine\n  * travel\n  * love\n\n### more\n\n  * Reader Center\n  * Wirecutter\n  * Live Events\n  * The Learning Network\n  * tools & services\n  * N.Y.C. events guide\n  * multimedia\n  * photography\n  * video\n  * Newsletters\n  * NYT store\n  * times journeys\n  * manage my account\n\n### Subscribe\n\n  * home delivery\n  * digital subscriptions\n  * Crossword\n  * Cooking\n\n  * email newsletters\n  * corporate subscriptions\n  * education rate\n\n  * mobile applications\n  * replica edition\n  * Español\n  * 中文网\n\n## Site Information Navigation\n\n  * © 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Work with us\n  * Advertise\n  * T Brand Studio\n  * Your Ad Choices\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Terms of Sale\n  * Site Map\n  * Help\n  * Subscriptions\n\n"

We're On It,' and Twitter asks, Are you guys OK?\n\nLisa Kaczke and Trevor J. Mitchell  Sioux Falls Argus Leader\n\nPublished 10:02 AM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. – People across the nation are talking about it: South\nDakota is on meth.\n\nThe buzz on both national news and social media focused on a new anti-drug ad\ncampaign led by Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nThe tagline? \"Meth. We're on it.\"\n\nNoem launched the campaign to bring awareness to the meth epidemic in South\nDakota, and the ad going viral on its first day shows that it's already a\nsuccess.\n\n\"The mission of the campaign is to raise awareness – to get people talking\nabout how they can be part of the solution and not just the problem,\" Noem\ntold the Argus Leader Monday afternoon. \"It is working.\"\n\n**'Meth. We're On It.':** South Dakota spends $449K on new anti-meth ad\ncampaign\n\nSouth Dakota's meth crisis is \"growing at an alarming rate\" and affects every\ncommunity in the state, Noem said in the campaign's public service\nannouncement.\n\n\"This is our problem, and together, we need to get on it,\" Noem said.\n\nNoem called the new campaign a \"bold, innovative effort like the nation has\nnever before seen.\"\n\nIn the coming weeks, South Dakotans will see the campaign in various media\nfrom TV to billboards to radio spots. The goal is to reach everyone in the\nstate and educate them on signs of addiction, resources available to fight\naddiction and strategies to engage communities in recovery, Noem said.\n\nThe state's Department of Social Services paid a Minnesota ad agency just\nshort of $449,000 this fall for their work on the campaign, according to the\nstate's finances website.\n\n\"I am confident South Dakota can lead the country in this effort and\ndemonstrate ways we can aggressively combat addiction and spark opportunities\nfor recovery,\" Noem said.\n\nTwitter seemed a bit confused by the campaign:\n\nPublished 10:02 AM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n\n© Copyright Gannett 2018\n\n"

Islam sudah sempurna sebelum\nNabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat\nNabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\n\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna\ndan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi,\nngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini\nbelum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\n\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syi’ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan.\nPendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja. Pendukung\nMuawiyah dan yg netral disebut Sunni.\n\nSetelah pecah itulah jalan sendiri2.\n\nImam Ja’far Ash Shadiq yg merupakan guru dari Imam Malik dan Imam Abu Hañifah\nmembentuk Mazhab Ja’fari. Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafi’ie\nmembentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam\nSyafi’ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafi’ie. Imam Ahmad\nbin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan\nmurid.\n\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni\nbikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih\nBukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di\nRijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama\nMu’awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\n\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan\norang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa\ndiajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\n\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah\njadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih\ndan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\n\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam.\nPelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.⁠⁠\n\nPenghinaan terhadap Istri dan Sahabat Nabi\n\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti ‘Aisyah ra dan\nmenghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra,\nUsman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat.\nHarusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\n\nSyi’ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib\ndan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video\nYasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan\nkemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara\nLondon dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke\nIndonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya\nuntuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\n\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib.\nBahkan Imam tertinggi Syi’ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena\nmengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\n\n## Ahmadinejad: Siapa Menghina Sahabat Rasulullah Sekutu Musuh Islam\n\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, “Dari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang\nsiapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah\nseorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam. Ia tidak lebih hanyalah\nkaki tangan dan alat mainan musuh-musuh asing.”\n\nhttp://www.ipabionline.com/2013/02/ahmadinejad-siapa-menghina-\nsahabat.html#ixzz2PpyAj3AN\n\n## Khamenei: Haram Menghina Istri Nabi dan Simbol Ahlusunah\n\nhttp://syiahali.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/fatwa-para-ulama-larangan-mencaci-\npara-sahabat/\n\n## Fatwa Para Ulama Syi’ah Larangan Mencaci Para Sahabat\n\nhttp://www.shia-explained.com/my/archives/2364\n\nSekarang kita lihat asal muasal penghinaan terhadap istri dan sahabat Nabi.\n\nSaya dulu merasa kehidupan semua sahabat rukun dan damai. Itu benar di zaman\nNabi. Saat Nabi wafat, timbul perdebatan siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin\nummat Islam sebagai Nabi. Kaum Syi’ah umumnya berpendapat Ali berhak menjadi\nKhalifah. Sementara mayoritas sahabat mengangkat Abu Bakar ra sebagai\nKhalifah. Suka tidak suka, semua sahabat membai’at Abu Bakar sebagai Khalifah.\nTermasuk Ali.\n\nSaat Ali jadi khalifah, Siti ‘Aisyah memberontak dalam perang yang disebut\nPerang Jamal yang menewaskan 17.000 orang. Saat Mu’awiyah berontak dalam\nperang Siffin pun ada 70.000 Muslim yang tewas. Dari pihak Ali 25.000 orang\nyang tewas. Dari pihak Mu’awiyah, 45.000 orang yang tewas.\n\nNah kalau para sahabat ini saling bunuh dalam Perang Jamal dan Perang Siffin,\ntentu diawali dengan perang lisan dan juga tulisan. Saling hina. Bisa jadi\ntulisan2 yang mengina sampai ke kita hingga sekarang. Ini mirip saat Pilpres\n2014 antara Jokowi melawan Prabowo di mana masing2 pengikut menghina yang\nlain. Bahkan Jokowi difitnah sebagai kafir sehingga keluarlah foto2 Jokowi\nsedang sholat.\n\nItulah asal muasal penghinaan istri dan sahabat Nabi. Itu satu lembaran hitam\nsejarah yang harusnya kita tutup. Menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi yg dilakukan\nsebagian kaum Syi’ah dan menghina orang tua Nabi yg dilakukan Wahabi itu dosa\nbesar. Cuma kalau taubat dan pemimpinnya mengharamkannya, ya selesai. Allah\nMaha Pengampun.\n\nManusia itu sifatnya salah dan lupa. Sebaik2 orang salah adalah orang yang\ntaubat. Nabi Adam dan Nabi Yunus pun pernah salah, tapi begitu tobat, diampuni\noleh Allah. Begitu. Makanya KH Quraish Shihab saat menilai Syi’ah itu sesat\natau lurus, beliau juga melihat perkembangan mereka. Yang tobat dan\nmengharamkan penghinaan thd sahabat ya otomatis tidak sesat. Sebaliknya yang\ntetap menghina, ini sesat.\n\nPenghinaan pun macam-macam tingkatnya. Dari sekedar kritik yang santun, hingga\npenghinaan yang amat amat keji. Kitabnya pun ada. Sahabat yang dihina pun\nmacam-macam. Dari sahabat Abu Bakar ra dan Umar bin Khoththob yang namanya\ndijamin Nabi masuk surga, hingga Mu’awiyah yang masuk Islam setelah Futuh\nMekkah da anaknya Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, Sayyidina\nHusein ra.\n\nMenghina Siti Aisyah ra, Abu Bakar ra, dan Umar bin Khoththob ra tidak\ndibenarkan apa pun alasannya. Sesat. Sebaliknya menyatakan bahwa Mu’awiyah\nberontak terhadap Khalifah Ali atau Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu\nNabi, itu sekedar kritik berdasarkan fakta sejarah. Namun kaum Sunni tetap\nmenjaga lisan mereka untuk tidak mengutuk atau menghina Mu’awiyah dan Yazid.\nUrusan mereka ada di tangan Allah.\n\nIklan\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Cetak\n  * Surat elektronik\n  * Lagi\n  * \n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Tumblr\n  *   * Reddit\n  * Pinterest\n  *   * \n\n### Sukai ini:\n\nSuka Memuat...\n\n### _Terkait_\n\nFiled under: Syi'ah |\n\n« Macam2 Syi’ah Ghulat yang Kafir Muslim Sunni Punya 12.000 Masjid di Iran »\n\n### Tinggalkan Balasan Batalkan balasan\n\nKetikkan komentar di sini...\n\nPlease log in using one of these methods to post your comment:\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nSurel (wajib) (Alamat takkan pernah dipublikasikan)\n\nNama (wajib)\n\nSitus Web\n\n****You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Abrams. Abrams was a producer on _Star\nTrek Beyond_ , and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth\nfilm.\n\n\"This will be Hawley’s second film\"\n\nThe fourth _Star Trek_ film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris\nHemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George\nKirk, the father of Chris Pine’s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years\nis a long time, and actors’ schedules shift. It’s unclear whether Hawley’s\nfilm is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return — both\nHemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018,\naccording to _The_ _Hollywood Reporter_. _The Wrap’s_ report today claims that\nPine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe\nSaldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn’t mention Hemsworth.\n\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth _Trek_ film,\naccording to _The Wrap_ , so it’s possible Paramount is still deciding on a\ndirection. As if things weren’t murky enough, _Deadline_ reports that\nParamount is also still working on a second, R-rated _Star Trek_ spin-off from\nQuentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017.\n\nThe fourth _Star Trek_ movie will be Hawley’s second film. _Lucy in the Sky,_\nhis debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing\nwith life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics — and flopped at\nthe box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box\nOffice Mojo.\n\nNo release date for the fourth _Star Trek_ film has yet been announced.\n\n##  Next Up In Tech\n\n###  Good Deals\n\n  1.

Carlineo Jr., 55, of Addison, a village southwest of Ithaca,\npleaded guilty to threatening to assault and murder a United States official,\nand being a felon in possession of firearms, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for\nthe Western District of New York said in a statement.\n\nCarlineo faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine.\nSentencing is scheduled for Feb. 14.\n\n####\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., speaks at the Capitol on July 25, 2019.J. Scott\nApplewhite / AP file\n\nDuring the call, he asked about the Muslim Brotherhood, called Omar a\n“terrorist” and said, “somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull,\" the\nprosecutor’s office said. Omar is one of the first two Muslim women elected to\nCongress.\n\nThe staff member who reported the call recalled that he said, \"I'll put a\nbullet in her (expletive) skull,\" the U.S. attorney's office said.\n\nCarlineo's attorney, Sonya Zoghlin, said in an email to The Associated Press\nthat Carlineo never intended to harm Omar.\n\n\"He has taken responsibility for using threatening and inappropriate language\nto express those beliefs in this instance,\" Zoghlin said.\n\nCarlineo is a convicted felon and possessed a loaded .45-caliber handgun,\nthree rifles, two shotguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition at his home,\nprosecutors said. He was convicted of criminal mischief in 1998 and was\nlegally barred from possessing a firearm.\n\nJames P. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York,\nsaid the case highlights that rights of free speech carry responsibilities.\n\n\"The First Amendment right to freedom of speech carries with it the\nresponsibility that individuals not make threats to harm lawmakers simply\nbecause they may disagree with them,\" Kennedy said in a statement. \"The Second\nAmendment right to bear arms carries with it the responsibility that\nindividuals who desire to possess firearms not commit felony crimes.\"\n\nPhil Helsel\n\nPhil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News.\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Careers\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * NBCNews.COM Site Map\n  * Advertise\n  * AdChoices\n\n© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\n  *   *   * \n\n"

Volker said he had no knowledge of any efforts to urge\nUkraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nMorrison was the third witness testifying Tuesday who listened in on President\nTrump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he\nwasn't concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would\nbe \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.\n\nRepublicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which\nhe raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman,\nwho is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona\nHill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\n\n####  Trump Impeachment Inquiry More\n\n  * Watch live: Sondland testifies about Ukraine at pivotal impeachment hearing \n  * Key moments from Kurt Volker's and Tim Morrison's testimony \n  * 7 key moments from Tuesday's first impeachment hearing \n  * Volker says he didn't realize link between Ukraine investigations and Bidens \n  * White House aides testify about \"unusual,\" \"improper\" Ukraine call at hearing \n\nMore in Trump Impeachment Inquiry\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\n###\n\n  1. \"My fears have been realized\"\n\nDay 3, Part 10: Tim Morrison's opening statement\n\nMorrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on\nJuly 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My\nfears have been realized.\"\n\nHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the\nillegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day\nthat the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings\ninstead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\"\nmutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n\n### 2\\. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\n\nVolker: Allegations against Biden are \"not credible\"\n\n\"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine\nto investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening\nstatement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have\nprovided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not\non the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I\nwas not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by\nPresident Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September\n25, 2019.\"\n\nVolker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation\ninto Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate\nUkrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he\nheard the July 25 call.\n\n\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not\ncredible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into\nBurisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how\nUkrainian officials could be confused.\n\n### 3\\. \"Not some irregular channel\"\n\nVolker insists he worked through \"official\" Ukraine channel, \"cringes\" at\n\"three amigos\" references\n\nVolker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been\nportrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was\nnot some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were\nknown as the \"Three Amigos.\"\n\nVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe\nwhen I hear it.\"\n\n### 4\\. Questioning Vindman's judgment\n\nMorrison discusses concerns about Vindman's judgment\n\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC\nabout Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his\npredecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the\nquestion was outside the scope of his testimony.\n\nMorrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had\nraised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect\nVindman denied earlier in the day.\n\nMorrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about\nconcerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal\ncounsel.\n\n\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've\nexpected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his\ntestimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National\nSecurity Adviser John Bolton — Morrison's supervisor — to go straight to the\nNSC legal counsel with his concerns.\n\nMorrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion\nfrom some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n\n### 5\\. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\n\nVolker says there was nothing unusual about hold on aid\n\n\"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it\non July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever\nknew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the\ndelay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\n\nVolker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of\nAugust, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\n\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold\nreleased, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was\nan internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said.\n\"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that\nsame time.\"\n\n### 6\\. \"The Gordon problem\"\n\nTim Morrison on \"the Gordon problem\"\n\nMorrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from\nSondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in\nforming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n\n### 7\\. \"The Giuliani problem\"\n\nVolker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer,\nRudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the\nnew Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call\nmade him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to\ninvestigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\n\"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Volker said.\n\nFirst published on November 20, 2019 / 1:07 AM\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

But a prosecutor would have\ndifficulty proving a charge in court.\n\nBy\n\nRandy Maniloff\n\nNov. 18, 2019 7:04 pm ET\n\nIt was the shot to the head heard ’round the world.

Mr. Garrett\nthen swung it at Mr. Rudolph, hitting him in the head.\n\nThe Pittsburgh quarterback didn’t suffer a concussion. Still, Mr. Garrett, who\nwas the first pick of the 2017 National Football League draft, has been\nsuspended without pay by the league for the rest of the season and may receive\nfurther discipline....\n\nTo Read the Full Story\n\nSubscribe  Sign In\n\n## Most Popular Videos\n\n  * #### Volker Saw No Harm in Investigating Unfounded Theories\n\n  * #### Standoff at a Hong Kong University Following Night of Violence\n\n  * #### Impeachment: Firsthand Witnesses Voice Concerns About July 25 Call\n\n  * #### Beijing's Response to Ruling Is Glimpse Into Hong Kong's Legal Future\n\n  * #### Nunes Pushes Vindman for Intelligence Contact, Schiff Complains\n\n## Most Popular Articles\n\n  * ####  Arizona Development Bans Residents From Bringing Cars\n\n  * ####  Epstein’s Jail Guards Charged With Conspiracy, Records Falsification\n\n  * ####  10 Places to Travel in 2020—Before Everyone Else Does\n\n  * ####  Former U.K. Consulate Worker Says Chinese Secret Police Tortured Him\n\n  * ####  Beware the Gift Card Scam\n\n* The Wall Street Journal\n* English Edition\n\n  * English\n  * 中文 (Chinese)\n  * 日本語 (Japanese)\n\n* * Subscribe Now\n* Sign In\n* Back to Top « \n\n* WSJ Membership\n\n* WSJ+ Membership Benefits\n* Subscription Options\n* Why Subscribe?\n* Corporate Subscriptions\n* Professor Journal\n* Student Journal\n* WSJ High School Program\n* WSJ Amenity Program\n* Customer Service\n\n* Customer Center\n* Contact Us\n* Tools & Features\n\n* Emails & Alerts\n* Guides\n* My News\n* RSS Feeds\n* Video Center\n* Watchlist\n* Podcasts\n* Ads\n\n* Advertise\n* Commercial Real Estate Ads\n* Place a Classified Ad\n* Sell Your Business\n* Sell Your Home\n* Recruitment & Career Ads\n* More\n\n* About the Newsroom\n* Content Partnerships\n* Corrections\n* Jobs at WSJ\n* Masthead\n* News Archive\n* Register for Free\n* Reprints\n* Buy Issues\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * Podcasts\n  * Snapchat\n  * Google Play\n  * App Store\n\n* Dow Jones Products\n* Barron's\n* BigCharts\n* Dow Jones DNA\n* Dow Jones Newswires\n* Factiva\n* Financial News\n* Mansion Global\n* MarketWatch\n* Private Markets\n* realtor.com\n* Risk & Compliance\n* Venturesource\n* WSJ Conference\n* WSJ Pro Central Banking\n* WSJ Video\n* WSJ Wine\n\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Policy\n* Copyright Policy\n* Data Policy\n* Subscriber Agreement & Terms of Use\n* Your Ad Choices\n* Copyright ©2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In a\nnew case study out Monday, they detail how the man came down with a rare form\nof allergy to the bird feathers that filled his new duvet and pillows.\n\nAccording to the study, published in BMJ Case Reports, the 43-year-old man had\nsuffered months of dizziness, fatigue, and breathlessness by the time he\nvisited his local doctor in November 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, his doctor assumed he had a lower respiratory tract infection, like\nbronchitis, and his symptoms did improve soon after. But by December, they\nworsened, to the point where he could no longer walk to the next room in his\nhouse without feeling out of breath. His doctor referred him to an urgent\nrespiratory care clinic and sought out advice from one of the study authors,\nOwen Dempsey, a chest doctor at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n\n“Their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion—think Donald Trump\nrather than Barack Obama”\n\nDempsey talked with the man over the phone, trying to zero in any potential\ncauses for his symptoms. And once the man mentioned that he and his wife had\nrecently switched from synthetic bedding to a feather duvet and feather\npillows, Dempsey quickly came up with a preliminary diagnosis that was later\nconfirmed by lab testing: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or HP.\n\nThe man had a particular form of HP that tends to strike people who raise or\nwork closely with birds, which has earned it the nickname of “bird fancier’s\nlung.” But in cases where people have gotten HP simply from being exposed to\nfeather bedding, it’s instead been dubbed “feather duvet lung.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In some individuals that meet proteins from bird droppings or dust from their\nfeathers, their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion—think Donald\nTrump rather than Barack Obama,” Dempsey told Gizmodo by email.\n\n###### E-Cigarettes Don't Have to Be Tainted to Send You to the Hospital, UK\nCase Shows\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of people in the U.S. have become acutely sick and\nhave even died due to\n\nRead more\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHP, as Gizmodo very recently explained, is a complex and rare condition. It\ninvolves different antibodies than the ones that cause a typical food or skin\nallergy. That means it isn’t detectable through a standard allergy test, nor\ndo people react instantaneously when they’re exposed to their trigger. It’s\nalso not clear why any one person develops HP, since many of us can carry\nthese specific antibodies to a trigger but never become sick.\n\n“Most people of course don’t get this, and it depends on how their immune\nsystem is primed and is affected by their genetics,” Dempsey said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Dempsey quickly suspected feather duvet lung, though, he told the man\nto remove the bedding from his home the very first time they spoke. And within\ndays, he began to improve. Subsequent treatment with steroids seemed to speed\nup his recovery, though Dempsey noted there’s no definitive evidence that\nsteroids will help with HP. Regardless, by the time he was weaned off\ntreatment a year later, he was back to normal.\n\n“It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,”\nthe man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the case report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it’s likely that more people contract feather duvet lung than is\ndocumented, given how hard it is to diagnose, it’s not something you should be\nworried about if you’ve been sleeping contently under a down-filled duvet with\nno issues.\n\n“Hold onto your feather bedding, but if you do get chest symptoms, e.g.\nbreathlessness or cough, mention it to your health care professional,” Dempsey\nsaid. “Most don’t think about it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Share This Story\n\n#### Recommended Stories\n\n###\n\nScientists Have Created a Vaccine for Cat Allergies, but You Can't Have It Yet\n\n###\n\nThe First Peanut Allergy Drug Might Be Approved Soon—but Not Without\nControversy\n\n###\n\nWhy Do We Get Allergies?\n\n#### About the author\n\nEd Cara\n\nEd Cara\n\nScience writer at Gizmodo and pug aficionado elsewhere\n\nEmailTwitterPosts\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\n"

        "articleBody": "### Welcome to The Detroit News’s EUROPEAN UNION EXPERIENCE\n\nLearn More\n\n#  Thousands of teachers pack Indiana Statehouse for protest\n\nTom Davies  Associated Press\n\nPublished 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\n_Indianapolis_ – Several thousand teachers wearing red surrounded the Indiana\nStatehouse on Tuesday to call for better pay and more respect from the\nRepublican-dominated state government in a protest that closed more than half\nof the state’s school districts for the day.\n\nThe union-organized rally represented Indiana’s biggest such teacher protest\namid a wave of educator activism across the country over the past two years.\n\nIndiana teachers wearing red have carry signs as they hold rally at the\nStatehouse in Indianapolis, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, calling for further\nincreasing teacher pay in the biggest such protest in the state amid a wave of\neducator activism across the country.\n\nMichael Conroy, AP\n\nTeachers chanted, “Fund our schools,” and “Put kids first,” as hundreds of\nthem lined entrances to the Statehouse, many holding handmade signs with\nsayings such as, “Less Money on Testing, More Money on Students.” Teachers\nwith marching band instruments played “We’re Not Gonna Take It” from the\nStatehouse steps.\n\nHigh school math teacher Angela Cooper said she and more than 40 fellow\nteachers from the Gibson Southern schools near Evansville left about 4:30 a.m.\nfor the rally. She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to\nleave for other jobs.\n\n“We need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,” Cooper said. “They\nstart in the classroom but then they leave because they aren’t paid enough.”\n\nIndiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand\nteachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct\nmoney from the state’s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\n“The crisis is now, and we need action now,” Gambill said to cheers from the\ncrowd. “The issue is funding, and the state has the money.”\n\nNearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers\nunions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of\ntheir 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than\n15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least\n5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency\ndidn’t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have\navoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings.\nThey seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt\nBevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers\nwho used sick days to rally. However, they said they don’t expect to take\naction on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\n\nOther teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and\nArizona.\n\nWhile some Indiana protesters chanted, “Red for Ed,” in a Statehouse hallway,\nIndiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state\nbudget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by\n2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted\nthe plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\n\nBosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test\nscores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state’s new\nILEARN standardized exam taken last spring – one of the top concerns of the\nteachers unions.\n\n“We get that you’re frustrated,” Bosma said. “We get that you are concerned\nabout issues.”\n\nTeachers didn’t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he\nwas keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of\nthe Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward\nHolcomb’s 2016 election campaign.\n\nThe governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in\nFebruary to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\n\nEducation advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was\nneeded to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states.\nRepublican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study\nshowing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since\n2002.\n\nMcCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the\nstate’s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they\nweren’t “asking for the moon.”\n\n“What a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,” she said.\n\nJoel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana’s Richmond High School, said\npoliticians have “vilified” educators.\n\n“They think they know better about education than us,” he said. “They don’t\ntrust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when\nwe’re in the classroom.”\n\nPublished 11:34 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n\n© The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper\n\n"

We decided to put ourselves out there – not knowing\nwhat we’d find – in an effort to chip away at any senseless stigma around this\nexperience and to encourage people who might be going through it to open\nthemselves up to love & support from friends and family when they need it\nmost.\"\n\n **LAUREN ALAINA SAYS 'DWTS' HAS HELPED HER LOSE 25 POUNDS**\n\nThose involved with “DWTS” struggled with the decision to boot Van Der Beek\noff the show.\n\n“This is not easy.

Of the total participants who filled\nin The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in those years, just over half\nwere female, 77 percent were aged 26 or above, 65 percent were white, 11.9\npercent were black, 15.36 percent Hispanic, and 7.3 of another race or\nethnicity.\n\nThe team looked at data on states where cannabis had been legalized by\n2016—Colorado,Washington, Alaska, and Oregon— and noted if and how often\nrespondents used marijuana in the past month, and whether they had cannabis\nuse disorder before and after the laws were enacted.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n  * Dangers of Vaping: Facts and Statistics on Health Risks of E-Cigarettes\n  * Cannabis Could Ease Symptoms of Depression in PTSD Patients\n  * These Are the Industries Where Staff Are Most Likely to Smoke Weed\n\nCannabis use disorder is where a person's use of the drug negatively affects\ntheir life over the course of 12 months. They might struggle to cut down, use\nso much it makes it hard to work or fulfil responsibilities in the home, and\nspend a lot of time taking the drug and recovering from its effects.\n\nIn adults aged 26 or older, the number who said they had used cannabis in the\npast month rose by 23 percent when compared with states where recreational use\nisn't allowed. Problematic cannabis use rose by 37 percent, from 0.90 percent\nto 1.23 percent, after recreational marijuana legalization.\n\nThe number of respondents aged between 12 to 17-years-old who had cannabis use\ndisorder rose \"slightly\" by 25 percent compared with those in the same group\nin other states, from 2.18 percent to 2.72 percent, the authors wrote.\n\nBut among participants aged between 18 to 25-years-old, the rates of cannabis\nuse in the past month, frequency and cannabis use disorder didn't change.\n\nA stock image of a woman holding a joint. Researchers have looked at the\nrelationship between legalisation and problematic use of the drug.  Getty\n\nMarijuana for recreational use has been legalized in 11 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia. Using weed occasionally is not thought to cause\nsubstantial problems, the authors said. But long-term, heavy use is linked to\nphysical and psychological problems, as well as lower educational attainment,\ndecline in social class, unemployment, and motor vehicle crashes, they wrote.\n\nSenior author Dr. Silvia S. Martins, associate professor of epidemiology at\nColumbia University Mailman School of Public Health, commented: \"Cannabis use\ndisorder in adolescence is associated with long-term adverse health, economic\nand social consequences.\n\nNeil Young's Plan to Vote Against Trump Suffers Setback Over Marijuana Use\n\nRead more __\n\n\"Given our findings on problematic use across age groups, legalization efforts\nshould coincide with prevention and treatment. The general public should be\ninformed about both benefits and potential harms of marijuana products to make\ninformed decisions,\" Martins said.\n\nIan Hamilton, an expert in drug use and mental health at the Department of\nHealth Sciences at the U.K.'s University of York who did not work on the\nstudy, told _Newsweek_ : \"Although the researchers found that regular use\nincreased by only a few percent following the policy change this could equate\nto a large proportion of the population given the popularity of cannabis.

The key to Stadia's success, says Buser, is\nGoogle's built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks\nin the world,\" he says, boasting that Google's servers can \"deliver extremely\nhigh fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless\nexperience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device\nthey choose to play on.\n\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was\nannounced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed\nlast week), featuring popular franchises such as _Assassin's Creed, Tomb\nRaider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny_ and more. Notably, only one title at\nlaunch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works'\n_Gylt_ , while most of the other games offered have been on the market for\nmonths on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia\nthroughout the end of the year and into 2020.\n\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm\nIDC, sees Stadia's lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly\nsubscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60\nframes per second and discounts on certain titles ( _Destiny 2_ is available\nfor free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for\nStadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the\ngames having been on the market for some time already.\n\n\"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google’s planned\n'free' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the\nhole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming\ncommunity...and that should seed interest in the Founder’s Edition bundle and\nPro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games\ncatalog will probably stay fairly thin and there’s a lot of other gaming\noptions out there.\"\n\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both\nof which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google's platform),\nStadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an\nextension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early,\nsenior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by\nletting people who maybe don’t own a console or PC join in.\"\n\n\"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-\nTwo, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader\ndistribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We’re excited by the\nopportunity and we’ll see how it goes.\"\n\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the\nindustry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not\nthe only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony\nNow service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project\nxCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with\nplans for its full launch set for next year.\n\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these\nservices in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\"\nWard says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by\nseveral of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\n\n\"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with\nadequate bandwidth or you’re not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York,\nbandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still\nsays Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the\nindustry.\n\n\"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having\nan experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist\ntoday. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will\nbreak the boundaries of what was previously possible. It's just staggering.\"\n\nWhile Stadia's current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only\nthree games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early\nsays there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and\nlaunched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best\ngame and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the\ninteresting question is if we’re getting to a place that requires a game to be\nrun in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not\nbe that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a\ncloud base, whether that’s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become\nsomething we'd look at.\"\n\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also\nstepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade\nsubscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was\nthe list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple's offering,\nall of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out\neach week.\n\n\"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches\nnext year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says\nWard.\n\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the\nfuture of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early\ngoing. \"This is where you’ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he\nsays. \"You’ll never download a game or have to download an update. We’re\nalready used to this in movies and TV, we just haven’t seen it in games yet.\nIt’s tough to go back to console.\"\n\n  * FACEBOOK\n  * TWITTER\n  * EMAIL ME\n\n  * Patrick Shanley\n\npatrick.shanley@THR.com @pshanley88\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n\n© 2019 The Hollywood Reporter  \nAll rights reserved.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC.\n\nTerms of Use | Privacy | Sitemap | About Our Ads\n\n  * About Us\n  * Daily Edition\n  * Subscribe\n  * Subscriber Services\n  * Back Issues\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact Us\n  * Tipline\n  * Careers\n  * Industry Jobs\n\n  * Follow Us On Twitter\n  * Find Us On Facebook\n  * Watch Us On Youtube\n\nOur affiliate publications\n\n  * Billboard\n  * Vibe\n  * Spin\n  * Stereogum\n\nCookie Settings\n\n"

Yet Sondland has already amended his\ntestimony once — “I now do recall,” he said, talking to Ukraine about\ninvestigations.\n\nSondland’s appearance at Wednesday morning’s hearing, and his closeness to\nTrump, is of particular concern to the White House as the historic impeachment\ninquiry reaches closer to the president, pushing through an intense week with\nnine witnesses testifying over three days in back-to-back sessions.\n\nTrump has recently tried to suggest that he barely knows his hand-picked\nambassador, but Sondland has said he has spoken several times with the\npresident and was acting on his direction.\n\nThe envoy is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers of both parties\nabout Trump’s July 25 call when he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\nfor the political investigations at the same time as U.S. military aid for the\nally was being stalled.\n\nSondland routinely bragged about his proximity to Trump and drew alarm from\nthe foreign service and national security apparatus as part of an irregular\nchannel of diplomacy led by the president’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nLast week State Department official David Holmes revealed one of those\ninteractions to impeachment investigators, saying he recalled it “vividly.”\n\nThe political counselor was having lunch with Sondland in Kyiv when the\nambassador dialed up the president on his cellphone and Holmes could hear\nTrump’s voice.\n\n“I then heard President Trump ask, quote, ‘So he’s going to do the\ninvestigation?’” Holmes testified. “Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘He’s\ngoing to do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will, quote, ‘do anything you\nask him to.’”\n\nSondland was known for telling others \"he was in charge of Ukraine\" despite\nbeing the U.S. envoy in Brussels, said another witness in the impeachment\nprobe, former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill.\n\n\"And I asked, well, on whose authority?” said Hill, who will testify Thursday.\n\"And he said, the President.\"\n\nSondland’s appearance follows the testimony Tuesday of four national security\nand diplomatic officials, including a career Army officer who described\nTrump’s call with Zelenskiy as “improper.”\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman told lawmakers it was his “duty” to report his\nconcerns about the call, as he deflected Republican attacks, including from\nthe White House on his loyalty and career in public service.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Vindman had registered his concerns over Ukraine\npolicy. He testified about a July 10 meeting at the White House when Sondland\ntold visiting Ukraine officials they would need to “deliver” before the\nadministration would agree to a meeting Zelenskiy wanted with Trump.\n\n“Ambassador Sondland referred to investigations into the Bidens and Burisma in\n2016,” Vindman testified, referring to the gas company on whose board Hunter\nBiden had a seat.\n\nAt the White House, Trump said he had watched part of the day’s testimony and\nslammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a “disgrace.” Over the weekend,\nTrump assailed Williams as part of the “Never Trumpers” who oppose his\npresidency, though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship.\n\nFormer National Security Council official Timothy Morrison told investigators\nthat he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Sondland and\na top aide to Zelenskiy. Afterward, Sondland said he had relayed to the\nUkrainian that U.S. aid might be freed if the country would announce the\ninvestigations, Morrison testified.\n\nAnother diplomat, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, shifted his own\naccount of the July 10 meeting to say Sondland did, in fact, discuss\ninvestigations with the visiting Ukrainians.\n\n“I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not\ncontinue and the meeting concluded,” Volker said.\n\nA series of text messages Volker provided to lawmakers showed conversations\nbetween him, Sondland and other leaders in which they discussed a need for\nUkraine to launch investigations, including into Burisma.\n\nVolker said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had\none in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani “raised, and I rejected, the\nconspiracy theory that Vice President Biden would have been influenced in his\nduties as vice president by money paid to his son.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram, Zeke Miller, Laurie Kellman, Colleen Long,\nEric Tucker, Lolita Baldor and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\n\n__ __ __ __ __ __\n\n### Topics\n\n  * Government and politics\n,\n\n  * Legal proceedings\n,\n\n  * Impeachments\n,\n\n  * Military legal affairs\n,\n\n  * International relations\n,\n\n  * Trump impeachment inquiry\n,\n\n  * Diplomacy\n,\n\n  * National security\n\n### Places in this Story\n\n  * Ukraine\n  * District of Columbia\n  * United States\n\n### Organizations in this Story\n\n  * Ukraine government\n  * European Union\n\n### People in the Story\n\n  * Rudolph Giuliani\n  * Joe Biden\n  * Donald Trump\n\n### Trending\n\n  1.

World Community Lashes Out at US for No Longer Considering Israeli Settlements Illegal \n\n# World Community Lashes Out at US for No Longer Considering Israeli\nSettlements Illegal\n\nPublished November 20th, 2019 - 07:29 GMT\n\nA man rides on a donkey in the Palestinian village of Kifl Hares opposite the\nIsraeli Jewish settlement of Revava (background) on November 19, 2019. Israeli\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed a US announcement that it no longer\nconsiders settlements in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem illegal, but\nthe Palestinians pledged new measures to oppose it. Jaafar ASHTIYEH / AFP\n\nHighlights\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\n**The United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on\nTuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal,\nwhile the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.**\n\nThe United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change\nthe reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned\nthe unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\"\nby the announcement.\n\nPompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the\nestablishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international\nlaw\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\n\nThe decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the\ninternational community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring\nsettlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did\n\"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the\nInternational Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\n\nThe EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\n\nNetanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of\nJerusalem on Tuesday.\n\n\"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the\nState of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic\ninjustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\n\nMore than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West\nBank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future\nPalestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nSettlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's\nadministration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as\nIsrael's capital.\n\nAnalysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off\npotential legal moves against Israel.\n\nThe Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\n\nThe Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the\nTrump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called\nfor an emergency meeting of the body.\n\nThe only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and\nJordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign\nMinister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\n\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of\nmeasures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\n\"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial\ninvestigation,\" he added.\n\nKey Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to\nvarying degrees.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure\ncontradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely\nfurther heighten tensions on the ground.\n\nThe French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to\nencourage... settlement building\".\n\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position\nthat settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to\npeace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\n\nThe US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context\nfor a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\n\nThe European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify\nproducts made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\n\nThe ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the\ncoming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\n\nIsraeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing\nconstituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of\nWest Bank settlements into Israel.\n\n\"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an\ninternational consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said\nAvi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\n\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the\nPalestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally,\nexternally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will\nstand tall.\"\n\n_This article has been adapted from its original source._\n\nVia SyndiGate.info  \n\n  \n\nCopyright @ 2019 The New Arab.\n\n## You may also like\n\nView the discussion thread.\n\n## You may also like\n\n####  Subscribe\n\nSign up to our newsletter for exclusive updates and enhanced content\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n####  Subscribe\n\nSign up to get Al Bawaba's exclusive celeb scoops and entertainment news\n\n  \n\n  * Latest\n  * Popular\n\n###  US: Top 100 Brands Are Worth More Than the GDP of Germany\n\n###  Dubai’s Non-Oil Trade with Africa to Exceed $272 Billion\n\n###  Next Khashoggi?

Click here to support it.\n\n__\n\n### Origin\n\nOn Nov. 15, 2019, former U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch\ntestified before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee in the impeachment\ninquiry against President Donald Trump. Shortly after, some of Trump’s\ndefenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming\nthat the ambassador’s net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because\nof some illicit means:\n\nWe have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\n\nThose making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found\nthat this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such\nas Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no\nevidence. Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her\npart, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her\nalleged fortune.\n\nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\n\nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17\nmillion, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net\nworth:\n\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is\nno credible evidence for the estimates.\n\nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and\nGossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch’s net worth far exceeded\nher salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered\nno evidence to support their estimates.\n\nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical\ninformation about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however,\nprovide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch\nmay have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead,\nthey simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making\nany attempt to justify that figure.\n\nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they\narrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information\nbecomes available.\n\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12\nmillion or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor\nappears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to\ndiscredit her U.S. House testimony.\n\nSnopes.com\n\nSince 1994\n\n##### A Word to Our Loyal Readers\n\nSupport Snopes and make a difference for readers everywhere.\n\nRead the Letter __\n\n##### Editorial\n\n  * David Mikkelson\n  * Doreen Marchionni\n  * David Emery\n  * Bond Huberman\n  * Jordan Liles\n  * Alex Kasprak\n  * Dan Evon\n  * Dan MacGuill\n  * Bethania Palma\n  * Liz Donaldson\n\n##### Operations\n\n  * Vinny Green\n  * Ryan Miller\n  * Chris Reilly\n  * Chad Ort\n  * Elyssa Young\n\nMost Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?” Those tips\nlaunch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of political,\nscientific, legal, historical, and visual information.

The 50 Best Nonfiction Books of the Past 25 Years \n  3. Jenny Slate and Her Editor on Refusing to Tidy Up Your Feelings in a Book \n  4. The Dark Enchantment of Carmen Maria Machado’s Memoir, _In the Dream House_\n\nThree years ago, over breakfast, my friend Helen handed me a novel about a\nquest that, unknown to both of us, would set me off on a quest of my own. The\nbook was called _The Dragon Waiting_ , and it was written by the late science\nfiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market\npaperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical\nfervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford’s\nobscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one\nof them.\n\n_The Dragon Waiting_ is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before\nGeorge R.R. Martin wrote _A Song of Ice and Fire_ , Ford created an alternate-\nhistory retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark\nmagic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy.\n_The Dragon Waiting_ provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of\nGene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellect ****\nensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with\nanother.\n\nI wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of\nthis mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It’s\ncurrently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not\navailable at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into\nthis level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford’s career, the more\nfrustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had\nwon the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a\nbeloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton,\nEllen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and\nDaniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn’t anyone\npublishing his books?\n\nIt would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to\nthe vast treasure trove of Ford’s uncollected and unpublished writing. It\nwould introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn’t spoken to each\nother since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John\nM. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed\nrepublication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen?\nMore importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly\nthan that: How did he write those amazing books?\n\nJohn Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago,\nIndiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane\nStarner, “He was brilliant from the start—reading at an adult level when he\nwas in kindergarten and talking to college students.” He played chess and\nloved model trains. But he was also sickly—after nearly falling into a coma at\nthe age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana\nUniversity, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and\namassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two\nyears, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first\nnovel, _Web of Angels_ , __ a cyberpunk book before the term was invented.\nPocket published it in 1980.*\n\nAfter that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His body of work resembles some\nbeast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs,\nguarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is\nmade up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often\nthan not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. “When\nyou’re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,” said Beth Meacham,\none of his editors at Tor. “Every book contained a puzzle of some sort. And\nthe play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple\nmeanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.”\n\nAll his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will\nbe utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital\nconnections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading,\nand faith that the author knows what he’s doing are essential for navigating\nthese moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the\nnovelist Jo Walton explained them to me. “You’re only seeing the tenth of the\niceberg that’s out of the water in every novel,” she said. “It makes it dense\nin a really _powerful_ way, but sometimes it’s too hard for people because he\nwouldn’t spell things out.” When his editors would ask him to explain himself\nmore, he’d respond, “I have a horror of being obvious.”\n\nFord also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people,\nand real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes,\nnor do they always understand what’s going on, particularly if they lack\npower, as Ford’s characters often do. If there’s one unifying theme to his\nbooks, it’s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In _The Dragon Waiting_\n, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed\nwith guilt after committing her first murder. _The Last Hot Time_ , an urban\nfantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own\ndesire to be a dom in bed. _Growing Up Weightless_ , a story of political\nintrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their\nchildren.\n\n“Had he taken _The Dragon Waiting_ and written a sequence of five books based\nin that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R. Martin.” — Neil\nGaiman\n\nBut the novels were only the beginning. The errata of John M. Ford could fill\nvolumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show\ncalled “Ask Dr. Mike” at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted\nout absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote\nhandbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the\nmaps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including _The Eye of the\nWorld_ , the first book in Robert Jordan’s _Wheel of Time_ series. His blog\ncomments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was a villanelle about King\nEdward IV.) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his\nChristmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or\nshort satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every\nyear during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called “Winter Solstice,\nCamelot Station _,”_ went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it\nhere.)\n\n“He would make art in the most surprising places,” Gaiman told me. “Once he\nwrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy\nFawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.”\nWhen Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he\nwould scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them\nfor her to find. “Life was not long enough,” she recalled, “for Mike to do all\nthe stuff that he would think of to do.”\n\n“He could have had a more successful career,” Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa’s\nhusband and Tor’s editor in chief, said, “if he had been more disciplined\nabout his writing” and stuck to one genre, or written a series. “But Mike\nwanted to write what he wanted to write.”\n\nNo single example illustrates this better than _The Dragon Waiting_ and its\naftermath. As Gaiman put it, “Had he taken _The Dragon Waiting_ and written a\nsequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been\nGeorge R.R. Martin.” Ford opted instead to write two _Star Trek_ novels ( _The\nFinal Reflection_ and _How Much for Just the Planet?_, both unexpected\ndelights) and _The Scholars of Night_ , a riff on midcentury British espionage\nthrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at\nits center. Gaiman still bemoans that _The Scholars of Night “_ should’ve been\nmarketed like _The Name of the Rose_. __ You needed to go, `We have a great\nwriter who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines\nhigh and low culture.’ ” Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St.\nMartin’s, published _Scholars_ with a blank back cover. It didn’t exactly do\nUmberto Eco–level business.\n\nNeil Gaiman and John M. Ford in 2002.\n\nPhoto by David Dyer-Bennet\n\nEven if Ford had found a larger audience, though, his health problems and lack\nof insurance would have kept his finances on the thinnest of ice. “All it took\nwas one bad infection and Mike would wipe out every penny he had,” Teresa\nNielsen Hayden explained. “To be an adult about money would mean to be\npermanently impoverished, give up on books, give up on travel, give up on the\nthings that made his life so much better. And so he didn’t.”\n\nTo the extent that Ford’s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare,\na health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a\nkidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made\npossible by the doctor’s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent\nthat his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends,\nparticularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited _The Scholars of Night_ , and her\nhusband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired\nFord to work as a “games consultant” for the _Wheel of Time_ series, mostly to\nhelp keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford\nas his “blood brother,” had essentially adopted him.\n\nFord needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family.\nThe causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his\nmother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner\nsays that Ford’s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford’s\nattitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote where God\ncheats at Scrabble. But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue\nwas Ford’s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.\n\nThe two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had\nbeen married for two years when she and Mike began dating. “My partner to whom\nI am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle\ninitial M,” Matthesen recalled in an email. “I used to refer to them\ncollectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.”\n\n“The thing with Elise bothered” Ford’s family, Starner said. “I don’t know\nwhether they were completely estranged before that or not.” But either way, at\nsome point, Ford’s now-deceased father told Starner that “the only way I know\nhe’s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.”\n\nIn his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words\nlong, titled _Aspects_. Beth Meacham described it as “a magical-parliamentary-\nnobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.” When he’d finish\nchunks of it, he’d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton,\nand Meacham. They were all amazed by it. __\n\nAlthough Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he\nstruggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard\nit was to weave action into some parts of the story. “It’s not exactly like I\ncan have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,” he wrote.\nThen, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so\ndelighted his friends:\n\n> If a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is\n> a high fantasy.\n>\n> If he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by\n> a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.\n>\n> If he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great\n> emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he\n> leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorker __ story.\n\nTwo months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He\nwas heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise\nMatthesen found him. “He looked a little surprised,” she wrote in an email.\n“Sort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.”\nAlthough he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was\ntherefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had\n“married,” but in a self-scripted Klingon ceremony during a convention. (“The\nKlingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,” was how\nFord described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford’s\nfamily, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford’s passing. She would\nhave one phone conversation with Ford’s mother. After that, everything would\nbe done through lawyers.\n\nAccording to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006,\nFord’s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his\nestate. But the document had been left in Ford’s apartment, which she could no\nlonger legally access. Matthesen and Ford’s friends wanted some say in the\ndisposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel\nwere unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford’s body, cleaned out his apartment,\nand, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own\nmemorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford’s\nimmediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but\nbitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, someone tried to edit\nFord’s Wikipedia page to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.\n\nBy 2018, when I started digging into this story, only _The Last Hot Time_ ,\nthe story collection _Heat of Fusion_, __ and the two _Star Trek_ novels\nremained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his\nmajor works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished _Aspects,_ had\nreverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford’s family. No\none had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal,\nand Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford’s literary estate and set up\na foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story,\nrepeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, online) was that Ford’s\nfamily did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of\nprint. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them\nfor comment on this article.\n\nAn agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement\ncommunity in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late\nnephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the\nfamily. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece\nwere suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford’s sister,\nMartha Fry. “I cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print\n**,”** she said.\n\nAll contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice\ndissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness.\n\nMartha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they\ncould do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of\nthat interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or\nhis parents, saying instead he was “introverted by nature.” “I once visited\nMike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,” Dale wrote. “We went\nto an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. …\nOur parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We\nfound some of the opened letters among his belongings.” Martha added that\nshortly before their father’s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the\nletter Mike wrote was “kind and loving.”\n\nThey also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike’s relationship with\nElise. “Mike’s personal life was his own business and did not affect our\nfeelings for him as a family,” Dale wrote. “I am appreciative to [Elise] for\nfinding Mike’s body and calling the police. … Martha read a copy of the police\nreport, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as ‘friend,’ not a legal\nspouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike\nfound caring friends during his adult life.”\n\nThey refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple\nfriends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote\nback, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that.\nFord and Fry replied that I was threatening them with “the unsubstantiated\nbeliefs of uncited individuals … if we do not respond to your satisfaction on\nMike’s commercial affairs.” However, they volunteered that on three separate\noccasions they had written to Mike’s agent, trying to see if there was any\ninterest in reprinting his work. When they didn’t hear back, they assumed\nthere wasn’t.\n\nThis seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford\nand wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal.\nWas it really possible, I asked Ford’s friends, that his agent could have\nignored his family’s requests?\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford’s agent had dropped out of\nthe industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick\nNielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford’s death, his agent Valerie Smith “was\nbeginning the process of essentially vanishing” from the industry. She “became\nmore and more intermittent” with phone calls and correspondence, and many of\nher clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her\nin a decade.\n\nAfter a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone. Smith still\nfound it difficult to talk about Mike Ford’s death and the events surrounding\nit. She had represented him since 1978. _Web of Angels_ was the first novel\nshe ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal\nbattle unrelated to her literary work left her “pretty overwhelmed,” she said.\nHer heartbreak over Mike Ford’s death, an event that still leaves her angry\ntoday, helped push her further out of the industry. “When I started, I really\nfelt like this was where I was meant to be,” she said. “I just can’t bring\nmyself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.” Smith said\nshe never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike\nFord’s work.\n\nAnd so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage,\nseeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths\nremained obscure. I do not share Ford’s horror at obviousness, but there are\nsimply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his\nfamily grew apart, or, from the family’s perspective, how far apart they were.\nWe will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out\nElise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)\n\nBut I reconnected Ford’s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of\ndelicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have\nreached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into\nprint, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other\nuncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me\nto Ford, _The Dragon Waiting_. __ Then, in 2021, Tor will publish—at long\nlast—the unfinished _Aspects_ , with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.\n\nAs in one of John M. Ford’s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached.\nIt’s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It’s not one that ties\nup every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that\nhappen. But the ending they’ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and\nleaves their world a bit better off than when they started.\n\nWhen I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of\nElise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford’s work, still smarting\nfrom the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?\n\n“I don’t even have words, it’s such good news,” she replied in an email.\n“Except maybe Mike’s words.”\n\nIn 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention. She put to him a\nprompt that had long been bouncing around in her head: _I’m going to die. Tell\nme a story_.\n\n“No,” he said. “No. You tell me one, and when you’re gone, I’ll tell it to\nsomebody else.”\n\nCorrection, Nov. 15, 2019: This article originally misidentified the first\npublisher of John M.

Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the “new Gannett,” as\nReed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the\nlargest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news\norganizations.\n\n> Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper\n> industry as a whole.\n\nNews industry analyst Ken Doctor\n\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of\nlocal news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and\nmanagements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough\nto take up the slack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast\nmajority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that\ndigital advertisers don’t much care for.\n\n“Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper\nindustry as a whole,” says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That’s\nproduced a strategy of “continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in\nlocal news.” The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media\ncompanies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\n\nThe merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said\nthat he expects to wring as much as $300 million in “synergies” from the\ncombination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the\nworkforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60\nemployees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it\n“immaterial”) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred.\n\nColumn: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in\nnewspapers — for plundering\n\nColumn: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in\nnewspapers — for plundering\n\nAmong those who believe that the press provides value for society — especially\nlocal journalism that slaps state and municipal politicians’ hands out of the\npublic cookie jar — Alden Global Capital is a “vulture investing” firm that\nmakes real vultures look good by comparison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register,\nDenver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and\nboasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the\npublicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources —\nwith good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about\ntwice the rate of the industry as a whole.\n\n(Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of\nTribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake\nheld by Tribune’s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9\nmillion.)\n\nBut public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can’t\nescape the industry’s economic challenges.\n\nSacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento\nBee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news\nindustry’s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue\nof $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss\nreflected a write-down of the company’s news assets.\n\nBut the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million.\nMcClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn’t have the cash or\ncash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its\npension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by\nthe government’s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\nMcClatchy’s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In\nDecember, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago\nTribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the\nformer owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly\ndemanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune’s largest shareholder.\n\nBusiness\n\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\n\nBusiness\n\nTribune Publishing renames itself Tronc as its dispute with Gannett continues\n\nThe owner of the Los Angeles Times has a new name and a newly elected board,\nbut it’s still dealing with some old business: dissatisfaction from some\nshareholders with its decision to spurn a buyout offer from rival Gannett Co.\n\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune’s large-\nmarket publications would have balanced McClatchy’s stable of smaller metro\nnewspapers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having\npaid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-\nShiong’s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500\nmillion. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major\nshareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.\n\nIndeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune.\nBoth companies declined to comment on the assertion.\n\nThe most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation\nin the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as\nAlden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any\nsavings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future,\nthe imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that’s where the\nnews audience has been moving to.\n\nGateHouse hasn’t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by\nPenelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm’s\npractice after acquiring a newspaper has been to “consolidate copy editing and\npage design” at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty\nreporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. “GateHouse-\nowned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,” Abernathy\nreported.\n\nReed, who will be the merged company’s chairman, told investors of New Media,\nthe GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to\nquickly pay down debt and “to return capital to shareholders through\ndividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.” It\nshouldn’t escape notice that it’s not always easy to reconcile using cash to\npay shareholder dividends with “investing for growth.”\n\nBusiness\n\nColumn: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\n\nBusiness\n\nColumn: Freelancers fear California’s new gig worker law will wipe them out\n\nFreelance writers and photographers fear California’s new gig worker law will\nmake them unemployable.\n\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of\nplunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress\nInvestment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as\na major player in the company through an initial public offering and a\nbankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract.\n\nFortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will\nleave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an\ninvestor conference call as “morally wrong.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I know we’re happy to get rid of Fortress,” Cooperman told Reed. “They\nbrought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they’re\ngoing to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn’t\neven take the money, given what they’ve done here.” (Cooperman is the\nbillionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her\nproposal for a wealth tax.)\n\nPlunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that\nremains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. “Financial\nplayers like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,”\nsays Doctor. “They see the way down as close to inevitable.”\n\nIn the news business that’s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public\ncompanies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have\nimposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on\nphysical delivery — McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all\nits newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles\nonline. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other\nnational-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.\n\nAs traditional revenues continue to decline — and at an ever faster pace —\nthose companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital\nnews requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says,\nthey’re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate\ndestination remains unclear.\n\n“After two more years of this,” Doctor asks, “what kind of products are going\nto be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital\nsubscription? What’s your strategy after all the cost-cutting?”\n\n* * *\n\nBusiness\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet our weekly California Inc. newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\nMichael Hiltzik\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * twitter\n  * instagram\n  * email\n  * facebook\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael Hiltzik writes a daily blog\nappearing on latimes.com.

Advice\n\n# Dear Abby: Husband springs for business class flight to India, but leaves\nwife in economy seat\n\nToday 12:01 AM\n\nBy  Abigail Van Buren\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband of more than 20 years just purchased plane tickets to\nIndia. It’s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in\nbusiness class, while I’m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply\ndoesn’t want to spend it. He’s older and has health concerns and mobility\nissues.\n\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than\nhis love for me? Or should I be content and happy I’m going to a beautiful\ncountry? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\n\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a\nbeautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your\npenny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you\nthan he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You\nhave a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either\nsit together or he’ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a\nrestaurant we’ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies’ room and was\nwashing my hands when a waitress I don’t care for came barging in, got in my\nface and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me out\nof the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling\nme no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\n\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said\nthat I started it. Another waitress who calls me her “sister” didn’t answer\nthe texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she\nbelieves the waitress, too.\n\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn’t\ncare. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I’m 74 and was\ntempted to go to the police but didn’t. Now I wish I had pressed charges.\nShould I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\n\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have\nwritten, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and\nfalsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to\nan emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about\nwhat the woman did to you.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The\nHPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our\ngeneration.\n\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if\nher granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had\nasked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have\ngrandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. --\nCONCERNED SISTER\n\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don’t\nthink your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was\nasked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that\nher granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually\nactive, which made her defensive.\n\n _Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips,\nand was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's\nthird child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10,\nduring which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of\nEpstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring.\n\nAndrew doesn’t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get\npizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me\nto do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"\n\nAndrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn’t have been with\nGiuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he\nhad a medical condition in which he couldn’t sweat.\n\n“Oh, actually? Yes,” he assures himself. “I didn’t sweat at the time.”\n\nBut, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he\nexplained that he can sweat now.\n\nAndrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if\nthere was any indication of Epstein’s crimes during the years in which they\nwere friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply\ncan’t remember.\n\n“There was no indication, absolutely no indication,” Andrew said. “And if\nthere was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the\n[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s] ‘Full Stop’\ncampaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those — time about\ngetting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to\nlook for but I never saw them.”\n\nThe fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn’t\nseem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.\n\nAs if all of this hedging wasn't enough to strengthen suspicion that the\naccusations are true, Andrew said he doesn’t regret his relationship with\nEpstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In\nother words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can\nteach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?\n\nThe interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew’s apparent guilt in\nassociating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's done,\" Giuffre _said_ before the interview. \"And I\nhope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nAndrew hasn’t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent\ndenials speak volumes. Let’s hope we see more of Epstein’s associates — from\npoliticians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as\nKatie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler — grilled about their\nconnections with him.\n\nUnfortunately, Andrew’s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his\n_publicist quitting_. After this, Epstein’s powerful friends will be more\ncareful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what\nappears to be guilt.\n\nOpinion\n\nBeltway Confidential\n\nRoyals\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\nSexual Assault\n\nMedia\n\n  * __\n  * __\n\n__ Share your thoughts with friends.\n\n  * \n\n  * #####  More Washington Examiner \n\n    * #####  Carlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\nAnthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nOur family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week. A year ago\nTuesday, our father, former Nissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn, was ambushed\nand arrested in Japan. He is finally free on bail, but his activities are\nhighly restricted. We don’t know when his trial will begin and when his\nnightmare will finally end.\n\n    * #####  Prince Andrew struggles to dispel allegations of sex with 17-year-old girl supplied by Epstein\n\nRob Crilly\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nThe television interview was devised as an opportunity for Britain’s Prince\nAndrew to set the record straight on his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey\nEpstein and end questions about whether he had slept with a 17-year-old girl.\n\n    * #####  What made _Joker_ so popular?\n\nMadeline Fry\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nJoker killed at the box office.\n\n    * #####  Sen. David Perdue: Democrats’ socialist agenda would kill the American dream\n\nSen. David Perdue\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nWednesday night, the country’s most liberal Democrats will descend on my home\nstate of Georgia and flood the airwaves with their radical, socialist ideas.\n\n    * #####  Surprise! Report claiming US has the ‘world's highest rate of children in detention’ is bogus\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nVarious outlets, including Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press,\nNational Public Radio, and Reuters, reported that a United Nations study\nshowed that there are more “than 100,000 children in migration-related U.S.\ndetention.” That sounds pretty bad. It means America “has the world’s highest\nrate of children in detention.”\n\n    * #####  Marie Yovanovitch is the only impeachment witness so far to demonstrate a legitimate gripe\n\nEddie Scarry\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nAfter three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so\nfar with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of\nthe impeachment pursuit of President Trump.\n\n    * #####  Media and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nIt is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and\npersonal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including\nAmbassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant\nSecretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie\nYovanovitch.\n\n    * #####  'Hate to cause a stink': FCC chairman declines call to investigate alleged Swalwell flatulence\n\nDaniel Chaitin\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe mystery of whether Rep. Eric Swalwell passed gas during an MSNBC interview\nwill squeak past scrutiny from the federal agency in charge of regulating the\nairwaves.\n\n    * #####  Kurt Volker throws Rudy Giuliani under the bus\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, has been tied to what Acting\nAmbassador to Ukraine William Taylor dubbed the “irregular channel” of Ukraine\npolicy, featuring Rudy Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and others. But Volker\nsought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday,\nmaking himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani’s meddling.\n\n    * #####  Democrats still haven't delivered 'the goods' on Trump impeachment\n\nJenna Ellis\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nPeople are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment\n“scandal.” In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly\nclosed — Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his\njob. Here is what we learned:\n\n    * #####  Impeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nBeyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-\nUkraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to\nUkraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr\nZelensky's efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.\n\n    * #####  First UK election debate was a total shambles\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be\nheld on Dec. 12 was a shambles.\n\n    * #####  Why the Democratic pivot from quid pro quo to 'bribery' is a bust\n\nTiana Lowe\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did\nPresident Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign\ngovernment to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats\nattempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the\npivot bombed fantastically.\n\n    * #####  It doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on\nTuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump’s dealings with\nUkraine — of which there were many — directly to his superiors. He did not\nleak those concerns to the press, he said.\n\n    * #####  Conservatives boycotting Chick-fil-A are silly\n\nKimberly Ross\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nMonday's news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no\nlonger donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community\nleft some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the\nmilitant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,\ncontinue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the\nannouncement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold\nChristian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\"\nwill not be satisfied.\n\n    * #####  'Just not accurate': GOP congressman rips _New York Times_ over Vindman tweet\n\nDominick Mastrangelo\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin accused the New York Times of spreading misinformation during\nits live coverage of congressional impeachment hearings.\n\n  * About Examiner\n\n  * Magazine Archive\n\n  * Staff\n\n  * Advertise\n\n  * Contact\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n  * Events\n\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * Terms Of Use\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n###### Copyright 2019.

Afterwards, The Tennis Podcast\nteam of Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts gave their initial\nimpressions of the new format.\n\nIs it fair to say that the event was neither as bad as the sceptics thought it\nwould be, nor as good as the organisers hoped it would be? Was it a\nmisjudgement to hold the opening ceremony at 2:30pm on a Monday? Why have some\nBelgian fans boycotted the event? Should the doubles rubber be scheduled\ndifferently to make sure it is always live? And in what way was an authentic\nDavis Cup atmosphere created by fans on the smaller stadiums?\n\nMuch of the focus on day one was about the feel and staging of the event,\nrather than forehands and backhands, but there’s also discussion about\nRussia’s straightforward victory against defending champions Croatia,\nColombia’s valiant effort against Belgium, and Canada’s exciting win over\nItaly.\n\nThe Tennis Podcast is produced weekly throughout the year, daily during the\nGrand Slam tournaments, the WTA and ATP Finals, and the Fed Cup and Davis Cup\nFinals.\n\n  * This week's Tennis Podcast is sponsored by the Davis Cup by Rakuten Madrid Finals, which takes place 18-24 November.

Instead, they\nlost 24-17.\n\n“We talked all along about everything we wanted was still in front of us,”\nLynn said, via the _Los Angeles Times_. “Yes, we needed to win this game\ntoday. I felt like if we could have won this game today and won out, we could\ncontrol our own destiny. But now, obviously, I don’t feel that way. I still\nthink we have enough to win next week and beyond that, but we probably are\ngoing to need some help.”\n\nAt 4-7, including 2-6 in the AFC and 0-3 in AFC West, the Chargers would\nprobably not make the playoffs even if they win out. And given the way they’ve\nplayed so far and the three games remaining against teams with winning\nrecords, there’s no reason to think they’ll win out. Lynn is right: The\nChargers needed to win that game.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * \n\nPermalink 34 Comments Feed for comments Back to top\n\n##  34 responses to “Anthony Lynn: “We needed to win this game””\n\n  1. **thelastchargersfan** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:34 am\n\nIt’s a good thing we have no fans left because this is a dumpster fire.\n\n  2. **joetoronto** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:44 am\n\nIt’s time for both Chargers fans to come to grips with reality, it’s over yet\nagain.\n\n  3. **theprocess12** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 6:58 am\n\nAs usual too many mistakes by Rivers. As good as the class of 2004 QBs have\nbeen one of them always leads in INTs. With Hill out the KC offense doesn’t\nlook that dynamic against a decent D. Don’t see how they can win 2 road\nplayoff games.\n\n  4. **v2787** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:02 am\n\nRivers is done. Get a new QB, Chargers. Philip has hit the wall. You’ve got a\ngood team, but you need a QB who won’t throw interceptions. That “shot put”\nstyle of passing that Rivers has isn’t working anymore.\n\n  5. **4hourelection** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:06 am\n\nFeckless Chargers. Always the same.\n\n  6. **margoadams** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:19 am\n\nAnother team suffering from a Super Bowl run hangover, courtesy of your New\nEngland Patriots. Demonstrates once again the incredible 20yr run the Patriots\nhave been on.\n\n  7. **MortimerInMiami** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:23 am\n\nChargers are on the clock!\n\n  8. **sammievee** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:42 am\n\nIf you needed to win, understand that teams that needlessly spike the ball in\nfinal minute, giving up a valuable play while letting a beaten fatigued\ndefense off the hook, usually loses that game. Instead, consider doing what\nlegit teams do–practice during the week while preparing a play just for that\nsituation. Then come up to the line of scrimmage and execute the play as you\nare not going to get a better chance than you had on first down with 24\nseconds left and the opposing defense in utter disarray. Reid was choking\nagain with the game management, I think I saw him doing high fives when Rivers\nspiked the ball and instantly turning the odds of scoring on that drive from\n80% to 15% with that decision to spike the ball in that situation.\n\n  9. **mroklahoma** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:13 am\n\nWhat’s he supposed to say?\n\n  10. **6ringsandarapist** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:32 am\n\nDid anyone really think the Chargers would win?\n\n  11. **lonespeed** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:45 am\n\nPhilip Rivers looked like an aging quarterback. He looked as if he was\nprojecting outward confidence, but he didn’t seem to have confidence in his\nability. Kinda like when you get tired at the end of a long golf round. It\nstarted to manifest itself in mental errors and forced throws that weren’t\ncrisp. Lots of batted balls and throws behind his targets. He might still be\nable to win a handful of games, but his days of leading a team to the playoffs\nare over. My guess is he retires at the end of this season.\n\n  12. **theguiceisright** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:53 am\n\n“Yes, I need to bench Rivers”*\n\nI actually don’t think Tyrod is that bad, plus he looks pretty sweet in a\nchargers uniform\n\n  13. **C. M.** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:56 am\n\nObviously Rivers didn’t want too\n\n  14. **solo681** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nWhy did you not have a plan to bench Rivers, if necessary, just in case – you\nknow, as it was necessary…\n\n  15. **jjackwagon** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:03 am\n\nTitans ran the ball right down the throat of the Chiefs D. With Gordon &\nEkeler, it makes you wonder why the Chargers didn’t do the same. Poor game\nplan?\n\nRivers is no longer a QB that can carry a team with his arm but they still\nthink he is.\n\n  16. **shutupbrees** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 9:47 am\n\ntwo weeks in a row the Chargers run for over 5.0 yards per carry, but insist\non letting Philip Rivers drop back 50+ times. He seems like a good guy, but\nhe’s done. He spends more time barking it up with opponents than any QB I’ve\nseen. It’d be funny if he wasn’t abysmal in the 2 minute drill throwing arm\npunt after arm punt.\n\n  17. **Bob. Just Bob.** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:01 am\n\nTime to put Rivers on the shelf.  \nThe dude just doesn’t have it anymore.  \nHe’s become an interception machine.  \nHe’s always been a risk-taker gunslinger type but it’s now gone past\nridiculous.  \nHave some mercy, Lynn; bench him while he still has a vestige of dignity\nremaining.\n\n  18. **6ringsandarapist** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:04 am\n\nFather time just pulled out his whoopin stick.\n\n  19. **bobmillion** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:13 am\n\nThe Chargers desperately need an O-coordinator that understands the players\nthey have, instead of being that young innovative guru of trying to throw the\nball on almost every play, especially with no tackles, try running the ball.\nThe Bears could run the ball against what looks like to be a much worse KC\ndefense, but idiot O-coordinator made Rivers throw the ball even though they\nhave a very good running game, which leaves Rivers trying to force the ball in\ndesperation as his career is clearly going off the cliff; sit him the rest of\nthe year and let him walk in free agency is the best thing the Chargers can\ndo, though Spanos will mess it up.\n\n  20. **jbaxt** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:15 am\n\nTwo things… Why would you stop running Gordon?\n\nAlso, several “experts” picked the Chargers to win the AFC West.\n\n  21. **devindenv** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 10:41 am\n\nChiefs Offense, without Hill, isn’t as dymnamic – as the poster above stated.\nIs that any f-ing surprise? But to say they cannot win 2 road playoff games\noverlooks the fact that the O-line. last night, was the first time in 6 weeks\nthey have Eric Fisher back and the starting LG was back for the first time 3-4\nweeks. Furthermore, tey are still down their best CB and a starting DE. The\nBye week comes at a great time for them. We shall see as they have OAK in Week\n13 and the Patriots in Week 14.\n\n  22. **fartweasel** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:32 am\n\nRivers is done. He just hasn’t accepted it yet. Great career, but his skills\nhave diminished. Time to retire.\n\n  23. **patsfan4lifesbchamps** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:33 am\n\nAnthony Lynn is in over his head\n\n  24. **psi0016000** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 11:46 am\n\nThe Chargers should sign Kapernick and make him the starter for the WHOLE 2020\nseason. In doing so, they will put and end to this ridiculous saga between\nKaper and the NFL, where both sides are at fault.  \nThis will also make possible, the transition from a declining and pathetic\nwould be Hall of Famer, to a long time ago Super Bowl Runner up. Who knows …  \nAnd then they should make a priority of ending up the 2020 draft, and 2020\nfree agency, with a boat load of OL, some of them being outright homeruns.\n\nOne last note : hire Dan Fouts as an assistant QB coach.\n\nHow about them Chargers !!!!\n\n  25. **Why I Love Football** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:05 pm\n\n“Their going to need help along the way” ? … Man, the Chargers are going to\nneed someone like Moses to lead them to the playoffs. I think Coach Lynn\nneeded this win more than anyone in order to stay employed. Chargers and Bears\nare in a league of their own. They are stuck with no where to go.\n\n  26. **smarter than you** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:07 pm\n\nWhat a worthless team, no history, no tradition, ugly uniforms, I’d rather be\na Bengals fan\n\n  27. **averagjoe** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm\n\nThe look on Rivers’ face after each of those four (count’em, 4) INTs should\nend all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.\n\n  28. **grumpysal** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:39 pm\n\nWatching last night’s game was like i was re-watching their game from a few\nweeks ago (?) where Rivers basically did the same thing (INT on last play) – I\nwondered during that game why the OC didn’t run the ball more and again last\nnight.\n\nAfter being IN that game a few weeks ago, did the Chargers coaches think a\ndifferent outcome was going to happen? I mean, do they even watch Rivers\nduring the game? He was downright awful.\n\n  29. **MightyMidwest** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:18 pm\n\nMight as well take your ball & go to Sacramento, San Diego, Portland or\nwherever.\n\nMaybe Mexico City is an option?\n\n  30. **cafetero1075** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 1:56 pm\n\nRivers has had bad seasons and bounced back. I think he can play well next\nyear.\n\n  31. **captainwhodat** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 2:25 pm\n\n“We needed to win this game”…said captain obvious.\n\n  32. **jjfootball** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 3:43 pm\n\nHis arm is a noodle at this point!\n\n  33. **a1b24312** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 7:34 pm\n\nMaybe JFisher wasn’t so bad after all? I mean, at least you got to 8-8 and one\nSB…\n\n  34. **Guy Hence** says:\n\nNovember 19, 2019 at 8:22 pm\n\naveragjoe says:  \nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:28 pm  \nThe look on Rivers’ face after each of those four (count’em, 4) INTs should\nend all talk about him going to the Hall of Fame.  \n==============================  \none quick read of your post tells us that you dont know a damn thing about\nfootball, the HOF or who should qualify.  \nRivers – even in his decline – is STILL better than your QB.\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to leave a comment.

Well, sort of. The group stage of qualifying\nfinished on Tuesday, and 20 teams have booked their spots in next summer's\ntournament, which for the first time will be held across Europe. Wales beat\nHungary 2-0 to earn the 20th spot on Tuesday. Aaron Ramsey scored twice for\nRyan Giggs' team, as country makes it back to a tournament where it made the\nsemifinals in 2016. The final four spots will come down to next March's Euro\n2020 playoffs, whose teams are determined by their performance in the UEFA\nNations League.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\n### There's still a chance for these teams\n\nAs it stands, each group of teams below will play a semifinal and final for a\nspot at the tournament according to UEFA as part of the playoffs, with each\npath having one berth:\n\n **Path A** : **** Iceland, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*  \n **Path B** : Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern\nIreland  \n **Path C** : Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*  \n **Path D** : Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus\n\n_*A draw will decide whether Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill\nthe empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A._\n\nFour teams from there will join the field of 20.\n\n### Clinching in November\n\nOn Monday, Switzerland and Denmark clinched. Denmark got a 1-1 draw at\nIreland, while Switzerland beat Gibraltar 6-0 to win Group D. The day before,\nPortugal made it as Bruno Fernandes scored the winner in the first half and\nCristiano Ronaldo put it away in the second half. Portugal allowed only one\nshot on goal and converted half of its four chances to make it seven victories\nout of eight in all competitions.\n\nCroatia, Germany, Netherlands and Austria all qualified Saturday. Croatia\nsecured its spot with a 3-1 victory against Slovakia, while Germany's 4-0 rout\nof Belarus was enough. The Netherlands clinched despite drawing with Northern\nIreland, while Austria punched its ticket by beating North Macedonia.\n\nOn Friday, it was Finland and Sweden's chance. Finland clinched 3-0 against\nLiechtenstein, while Sweden did the same, 2-0, at Romania.\n\nAnd earlier in the week, Turkey drew Iceland 0-0 in Istanbul to book its spot,\nand that result also clinched France's ticket to next year's tournament, with\nthe reigning World Cup champs looked at as one of the heavy favorites.

(AP)\n\nIn October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near\nMcAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border\nsecurity, including more border patrol agents.\n\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley\nsaid, is the flow of drugs into the country.\n\nBorder agents \"say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is\ncoming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer,\nthe Wheeling News-Register.\n\nIs this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he\nappears to be in the ballpark.\n\nWe’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns\ndrugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming\nthrough undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\n\nAs a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer\nto the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide\nPolitiFact with further information.)\n\nHere’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana,\nmethamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection\nmeasures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So\nto approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\n\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October\n2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data\nfrom the University of Colorado.\n\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We\ndecided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange\nCounty, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October\n2019.\n\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019\nseizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\n\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2\nmillion per week.\n\nThat’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the\nballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and\ncertainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies\nat the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\n\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and\nmethamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear\nhow pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for\nColorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as\na whole.\n\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the\nseizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian\nborder. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico\n\"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that\n\"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in\nthe United States.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\n\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is\nseized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at\nabout $44 million. That’s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a\nreasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value\nfluctuations and other limitations of the data.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### About this statement:\n\nPublished: Monday, November 18th, 2019 at 11:08 a.m.\n\nResearched by: Matthew Digby, Minh Do\n\nEdited by: Louis Jacobson\n\nSubjects: Crime, Drugs, Immigration\n\n### Sources:\n\nThe Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register, \"Rep.

Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent,\nwhile sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new\nvehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\n“People are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,”\nInfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, “2019 is just not as strong as\n2018.”\n\n**On HoustonChronicle.com:** Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\n\nThe sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan\nstayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage\nrate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2\npercent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based\nautomobile data firm.\n\nIndustry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten\ndeals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year.\nThe Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a\nquarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder\nof the year.\n\n“The end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle\npurchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry\nanalysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or\nSUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower\nfinancing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\n\n**On HoustonChronicle.com:** Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales\n\nDespite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing.\nThe average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014,\nup from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\n\nThe average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the\naverage price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New\ninfotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup\ncameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up,\nMcDowell said.\n\nHouston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments\n-- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle\nsales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September,\nit’s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month\naverage of 15.2 percent.\n\nNationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an\nincrease of just 0.3 percent from 2017. Edmunds expects 16.6 million vehicles\nwill be sold this year.\n\n_\n\npaul.takahashi@chron.com\n\ntwitter.com/paultakahashi\n\n_\n\n## More Business News\n\n  * ### Houston Housing Authority sued over alleged open meeting...\n\n  * #### New car sales plunge 10 percent in October\n\n  * #### Houston leads Texas in new home sales volume\n\n  * #### Report: Bank of America Tower sells for record per-foot price\n\n  * #### Oil falls most in 7 weeks amid supply rise, trade impasse\n\n  * #### Houston’s economy might not be as hot as it looks — and...\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 1\n\n#####  47 nabbed in massive Katy human-trafficking sting\n\n  * 2\n\n#####  Human trafficking, prostitution sting near The Woodlands nets 75\n\n  * 3\n\n#####  14-year-old girl missing from The Woodlands, last seen at mall\n\n  * 4\n\n#####  Cleveland ISD: White van being used to lure children\n\n  * 5\n\n#####  J.J.

First it was hard to breathe, then dizzy spells\ncaused by any amount of exertion.\n\n\"Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for\nmore than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass\nout,\" wrote 43-year-old Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in a case\nstudy published Monday in the journal BMJ.\n\n\"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 minute activity, as I could only manage two\nstairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" Taylor added.\n\nFour doctor appointments failed to find the cause, which was \"extremely\ndistressing,\" wrote Taylor, who had never smoked. With his health failing, he\nstayed home from work and spent most of his days and nights asleep.\n\nTaylor didn't know at the time that he was suffering from hypersensitivity\npneumonitis, a disease in which lungs become inflamed as the result of an\nallergic reaction. Caught early, the disease is easily treatable. Undiagnosed,\nit can lead to permanent lung scarring, and even death.\n\nUnfortunately, in Taylor's case, the doctors he first saw had no clue as to\nthe cause.\n\n### Time for Dr. Sherlock\n\nAt first Taylor was treated for an upper respiratory infection. But his health\ncontinued to decline over the next three months. Then a radiologist dismissed\na chest X-ray of his lungs as normal.\n\nConcerned, his family doctor put in a call to the urgent respiratory clinic\nand spoke to Dr. Owen John Dempsey, a consultant chest physician at BMI Albyn\nHospital in Aberdeen, Scotland, about a 30-minute drive from Aberdeenshire.\n\n\"His general practitioner was very astute in not accepting the chest X-ray\nresult at face value,\" Dempsey said, adding that it can be difficult to\ndiagnose hypersensitivity pneumonitis because the changes are often subtle\nwith just a \"slight diffuse greyness to the lungs.\"\n\n\"I think the radiologist may have thought it was just a slightly 'under-\nexposed' chest X-ray,\" Dempsey said.\n\nDempsey picked up the phone and rang Taylor.\n\n\"He sounded very breathless, having just walked from one room in his house to\nthe other,\" Dempsey said. \"Very abnormal for such a young man. It was clear\nthe patient had progressive and really very disabling breathlessness, now\ninterfering with activities of daily life.\"\n\nMaking the diagnosis was \"a bit like a jigsaw,\" Dempsey said. One of the first\nclues was Taylor's blood work, which showed his immune system was exposed to\navian protein. However, Taylor told Dempsey he didn't own any birds, just a\ncat and dog.\n\n\"I have a particular interest in this group of diseases,\" Dempsey said. \"And\nwe know that if you take a meticulous history, you can often identify triggers\nin the environment for lung diseases.\"\n\nDempsey dove deeper: Taylor lived in a warm, dry house with his wife. They had\na loft, which he didn't visit much, but they did have an en-suite bathroom\nwith a bit of mold above the shower and window. He hadn't traveled to a\nforeign area. He had no drug history. He worked in an office with no obvious\nexposures. And he played guitar and saxophone in a local band.\n\n\"We are paid to be nosy,\" Dempsey said. \"The danger is that we don't ask\nenough and assume diseases are 'idiopathic' or unexplained. If so, we miss a\ntrick and our patients are subjected to unnecessary tests or treatments.\"\n\nFinally, Dempsey's questions hit pay dirt: The couple had recently replaced\ntheir synthetic bedding with a feather duvet and feather pillows. Taylor had\nFeather Duvet Lung disease.\n\nAs Sherlock would say, \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"\n\n### Feather Duvet Lung disease\n\nBird allergies are not uncommon. Often called bird fancier's asthma, symptoms\ncan range from a wheezy cough, runny nose and eye irritation to asthma to more\nserious complications such as Taylor's. People with allergies are most at risk\nwhen bird cages or lofts are cleaned out, and during the time of year when\nbirds molt and shed their feathers.\n\nFeather Duvet Lung disease is a subset of bird fancier's asthma, and it's\ndifficult to diagnose because of its rarity and the wide variety in timing and\ntype of symptoms.\n\nOnset of symptoms following exposure to new feather duvets or pillows can\nrange from three weeks to five years. Difficulty in breathing can grow over\ntime, and the patient can have night sweats, dry cough, weight loss and fever.\nThe condition is often misdiagnosed if the person reports no birds in the\nhome, and many doctors don't think to ask about bedding.\n\n\"Most doctors, in my experience, don't ask that level of detail,\" Dempsey\nsaid, adding that doctors should always ask about exposures at home, including\nbedding, molds, the warmth and dryness of the home, and any unusual hobbies or\npastimes.\n\nEarly recognition of avian antigen exposure and removal of the bedding or\nother irritant is critical to recovery for patients, Dempsey stressed.\n\n### Successful treatment\n\nWhile studies have not always supported the use of steroids, in this situation\nthey were successful, especially since Taylor also removed the feather\nbedding.\n\n\"The steroids which were prescribed after diagnosis ... had a transformative\neffect within two days,\" Taylor wrote. **\"** The course of steroids continued\nultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have\nthankfully been able to stop them completely.\n\n\"I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn't affect me at all\nnow and my life is pretty much as it was before.\"\n\n© Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire, Scotland Martin Taylor of Aberdeenshire,\nScotland\n\nRead More\n\nMicrosoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through\nrecommended links in this article.\n\nAdChoices\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n#### YOU MAY LIKE\n\nAd Microsoft\n\n  * 24 Discounts Seniors Are Entitled To\n\niLoveRetirement\n\n  * Jaw-Dropping Card Offers 0% Interest Until 2021\n\nThe Ascent\n\n  * Forget Amazon; Here’s a Better Stock to Buy\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\n##  More From CNN\n\n  * ### Simon Cheng: Former British consulate worker says he was tortured during China detention\n\n  * ### Best trips for 2020, according to National Geographic\n\n  * ### Ohio University fraternity pledge death: 10 people indicted after investigation into the death of an 18-year-old student\n\nVisit site\n\nAdChoices\n\nFeedback\n\n  * © 2019 Microsoft\n\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * Terms of use\n  * \n\n  * About our Ads\n  * Help\n  * Newsletter\n  * MSN Worldwide\n  * Disclaimer\n  * About Health\n  * MSN Blog\n  * About Us\n  * Editorial Standards\n\n  *   * \n\n  *   * \n\n## Found the story interesting?\n\nLike us on Facebook to see similar stories\n\nI'm already a fan, don't show this again  \n\n## Send MSN Feedback\n\n## We appreciate your input!\n\nHow can we improve?\n\nPlease give an overall site rating:\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nSubmit Close\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\nHelp\n\nHelp & Support\n\nClose\n\n## Make MSN my homepage\n\n  * On the toolbar, click Safari.

Lee  Senior Contributor\n\nOpinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.\n\nHealthcare\n\nI am a writer, journalist, professor, systems modeler, computational and\ndigital health expert, avocado-eater, and entrepreneur, not always in that\norder.\n\n  * Share to facebook __\n  * Share to twitter __\n  * Share to linkedin __\n\nHow can a duvet affect your lungs when it is too big to go up your nostrils?\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nThe Corrs’ song “Breathless” probably doesn’t refer to a duvet. However, it\nwas this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a\nserious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal\n_BMJ Case Reports_.\n\nWondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and\neven eventually be life-threatening? Well, go on, go on. This case report may\nleave you breathless.\n\nFor the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris\nRuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary\nin the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November\n2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor\ninitially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but\ncontrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn’t get better afterwards. In\nfact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the\npoint where he couldn’t walk from one room to another without getting out of\nbreath.\n\nHere is how bad things got in the words of the patient: “Two months after the\nonset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few\nminutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs\nto bed was a 30 min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and\nthen needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time\nasleep (day and night).”\n\nAt first glance, the man didn’t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless.\nHe wasn’t a smoker. His workplace didn’t expose him to anything unusual. His\nmain hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated\nthat he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils.\n\nAh, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently\n“acquired” both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go\non, go on.\n\nBreathing tests showed that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much\nair as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren’t moving as well between\nhis lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\n\nA CT of his chest showed a “ground glass” pattern in both of his lungs. Some\nlymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were\nconsistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\nHP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your\nlungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to\nbreathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird\ndroppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers.\nWhen the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called “feather\nduvet lung.” When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is “bird\nfancier’s lung.” When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called\n“pigeon breeder’s lung.” If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken\ncostume, well that doesn’t occur often enough to have its own name.\n\nWait there’s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what’s\ncalled “farmer's lung,” not to be confused with a farmer’s tan. “Humidifier\nlung” may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some\nsimilar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is “hot tub\nlung,” which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn’t. The bacteria in hot tubs\ncan travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it’s not\nalways good if what’s in a hot tub makes you breathless.\n\nNot all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic\nreaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo:\nGetty Images)\n\nGetty\n\nThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm\nthe reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the\nfeather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling\nof mold. According to the man, the steroids “had a transformative effect\nwithin 2 days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the\nallergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.”\n\nEventually everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, “the course\nof steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in\ndose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen\nsaturation level nowadays is regularly 97%–98% which I understand to be normal\nfor someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It\ndoesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.”\n\nFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the\ninflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can\nresult. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible.\nNot surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe\nand exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life\nthreatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\n\nSo, if something is leaving you breathless and it’s not someone you fancy, you\nmay want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic\nreaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap\nor anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the\nmany bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it’s the pigeons\nthat you are breeding in your kitchen.\n\nBefore you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the\nflocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like\n“feather duvet lung” are still relatively uncommon. That’s why this case\nbecame a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may\nhave seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where even the\nslightest touch and you feel weak.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed\nthree Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\n\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in\nstalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul\ngovernment and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s\n18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US\ntroops.\n\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the\nTaliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla\ninsurgent group’s Haqqani network.\n\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a\npolitical office, according to a Taliban representative.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us\nhope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United\nStates stands ready to support.\n\n“We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible\nand costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a\npolitical settlement.”\n\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their\nordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press\nSecretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions,\nin the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.”\n\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last\nweek, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to\nthe front line.\n\nHe also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct\ntalks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to\nnegotiate peace with Kabul.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are\nprofoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’\nfamily had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\n\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart\nof Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two\nvideos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale\nand gaunt.\n\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their\ngovernments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether\nthey were forced to speak.\n\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the\nhostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\n\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement\nfor US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal\nwhen President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n  * \n\nFiled under afghanistan ,  hostages ,  middle east ,  prisoners ,  taliban\n\n### Share this article:\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n  * \n\nRead Next\n\nTeen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\nRead Next\n\nTeen chased by police breaks both legs with airport termin...\n\nShare Selection\n\n####  Trending Now on NYPost.com\n\n  1.

(AP) — About a dozen black female small-business owners were\ngathered in a South Carolina shared workspace on Tuesday night for a\nnetworking event when they were told the newest 2020 Democratic presidential\nhopeful, Deval Patrick, would be stopping by to introduce himself.\n\nWhen Patrick walked into the back of the room mid-meeting, the women turned\naround as he sheepishly apologized for his tardiness and short stay.\n\n“Don’t mind me!” he told them.\n\nBut the black former Massachusetts governor is eager to get their attention —\nand their vote.\n\nLaunching his bid for president less than three months before the Iowa\ncaucuses, Patrick is betting that he can make his case to a broad coalition of\nvoters, including many who remain undecided or uncommitted to anyone in the\ncrowded field of candidates. To win South Carolina, which holds the first\nSouthern primary of 2020, he would need a base of support from the black\nvoters who comprise roughly two-thirds of the state’s Democratic electorate.\n\n“I’m running for president because those values of community, that we have a\nstake in each other and of generational responsibility, I think, are frayed in\nthe country,” Patrick said Tuesday night in Columbia. “I come in humbly. ... I\nwant to be a listener.”\n\nArguing that voters are just now beginning to tune in, with the first votes\nless than 100 days away, Patrick has said he will have visibility when the\npopulace is really paying attention. His late entry, though, makes it that\nmuch tougher to raise the awareness that his campaign will need to meet the\npolling and fundraising thresholds for future debates.\n\nThis week, Patrick launched a tour of early-voting states, visiting Nevada and\nIowa before South Carolina. It’s a state where former Vice President Joe Biden\nhas maintained a significant polling lead for months, both across all\nspectrums and with black voters specifically.\n\nIt’s also a place where the two other major black candidates in the race —\nSens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris — have struggled to gain momentum, despite\nmonths of campaign events.\n\nEyamba Sowers didn’t know Patrick was coming to Tuesday’s networking gathering\nbut saw his visit as a pleasant surprise. The real estate agent said she\nrelated to him as someone who was also raised in a single-parent home, and she\nwas impressed with his status as the country’s second elected black governor.\n\n“He has me thinking now,” said Sowers, who is also considering Bernie Sanders\nand Joe Biden. She said if Patrick can get his message out, he’s someone\nvoters could see defeating President Donald Trump in 2020 — her top priority.\n\nBeth Ruffin said she didn’t know much about Patrick before Tuesday’s event,\nbut he left her intrigued and wanting to learn more. A former Beto O’Rourke\nsupporter, she is a voter back on the market since his departure from the\npresidential race.\n\n“It sounded like strong black women raised him,” said Ruffin, who owns a\ndiversity and inclusion consulting firm and headed out for Patrick’s second\nstop at a nearby restaurant, where he was warmly greeted by a crowd of several\ndozen. “I want to see how he translates that into policy.”\n\n___\n\nReach the reporters on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP and\nhttp://twitter.com/emarvelous\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 1\n\n#####  Longtime CT gunmaker leaving state for Wyoming\n\n  * 2\n\n#####  Shelton teacher realizes dream on Wheel of Fortune\n\n  * 3\n\n#####  Police call disappearance of bar owner ‘suspicious’\n\n  * 4\n\n#####  Fairfield dumping documents unsealed\n\n  * 5\n\n#####  3 busted after CT raid finds fentanyl-laced heroin\n\n  * 6\n\n#####  Brickyard Pub owner charged with selling cocaine at Fairfield\nrestaurant\n\n  * 7\n\n#####  Police: Gift card scam costs Derby woman nearly $10K\n\n> Connecticut Post\n\nView Comments\n\n© 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc.\n\nLogo Return to Top\n\n### About\n\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Interest Based Ads\n  * Your California Privacy Rights\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Careers\n  * Advertising\n  * Archives\n\n### Contact\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * FAQ\n  * Today's eEdition\n  * Submissions\n\n### Connect\n\n  * Newsletter Sign-Up\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\nHearst Newspapers © Copyright  Hearst Media Services Connecticut, LLC\n\n"

At the time, Lexus\ncalled the vehicle a concept despite looking ready to hit showrooms and\nstreets worldwide.\n\nNow, at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Japanese luxury marque has finally\npulled the covers off the production model 2020 LC 500 Convertible.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the LC 500 Convertible looks largely similar to the LC\nConvertible Concept previewed in January. Most of the design cues has simply\nbeen carried over. However, it seems the more stylish wheels on the Concept\nappears to have been ditched in favor of the standard units fitted on the\nCoupe.\n\nStyling-wise, the biggest difference between the Convertible and the standard\nLC 500 would be the lack of a roof and a revised rear deck. In place of a\nfixed metal roof and the large backglass is a retractable fabric soft top.\nLexus engineers have hidden the frame underneath the material so that it won’t\nbe seen with the roof in place. No doubt the LC 500 Convertible looks very\nstylish with the roof down. However, some might find it’s roofline a bit\nstrange with the soft-top roof up.\n\nShould the weather take a turn for the worse, drivers can operate the folding\nsoft-top to close in just 16 seconds at speeds at up to 50 km/h. Meanwhile, it\njust takes 15 seconds to fold the roof down and give occupant open-air\nfreshness. The air-conditioning system also automatically adjusts cabin\ntemperature whether the top is up or down. The rest of the cabin has simply\nbeen carried over from the coupe.\n\nIn order to make up for the lack of a roof, Lexus Project Manager Fumihiko\nHazama shared with AutoIndustriya.com that they have improved chassis rigidity\nby adding x-braces. The front suspension has also been revised in order to\nreduce unsprung weight. At the rear, the suspension brace has been relocated\nand reshaped in order to improve structural rigidity.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s the same 5.0-liter V8 engine which produces 471\nhorsepower and 540 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a\n10-speed automatic transmission. To hear the V8 better, a pipe channels engine\nnoise into the cabin.\n\nThe Lexus LC 500 Convertible will go on sale in summer 2020. Considering how\nLexus Philippines offers almost all Lexus models locally, it's possible the\nLC500 Convertible could arrive in the future.\n\n\\- Next Auto News __\n\n##### 2020 Mini JCW GP is a 300HP monster hatch\n\nThe most powerful Mini hot hatch to come out of Oxford has 306 HP and a huge\nrear wing\n\n__ Marcus De Guzman __ 2019-11-20 17:27:46\n\n__ Previous Auto News -\n\n##### Renault to challenge Xpander, Avanza with 7-seat 2020 Triber\n\nRenault's latest seven-seater MPV only measures less than 4 meters long\n\n__ 2019-11-20 12:57:32 __ Marcus De Guzman\n\n__ Tags:lc 500 lexus lexus lc lexus lc 500 lexus lc convertible\n\n__ MORE STORIES LIKE THIS ONE\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2017 Lexus LC500 coupe arrives in the Philippines\n\n__May 15, 2017\n\nCAR REVIEWS\n\n##### 2017 Lexus LC 500\n\n__January 22, 2018\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### NAIAS 2016: All-new Lexus LC500 makes world premiere\n\n__January 12, 2016\n\nADVERTORIAL\n\n##### 5 reasons why a Lexus hybrid is the perfect first step to electrified\ndriving\n\n__October 18, 2019\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Drop top 2019 Lexus LC Convertible is a gorgeous breath of fresh air\n\n__January 14, 2019\n\nFEATURES\n\n##### First Impressions: 2013 Lexus IS 350, IS 350 F Sport\n\n__June 18, 2013\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### This topless Hyundai Santa Fe is the strangest thing you'll see today\n\n__September 12, 2018\n\nCAR REVIEWS\n\n##### 2018 Lexus ES 350\n\n__October 19, 2018\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments\npowered by Disqus\n\n__ FIND YOUR NEXT CAR\n\nChoose vehicle brand AbarthAlfa RomeoAston\nMartinAudiBAICBentleyBMWBYDChanganChevroletChryslerDodgeFerrariFordFotonGACGeelyGreat\nWallHaimaHondaHyundaiIsuzuJACJaguarJeepJMCJoylongKiaLamborghiniLand\nRoverLexusLifanLotusMahindraMaseratiMaxusMazdaMercedes-\nBenzMGMiniMitsubishiNissanPeugeotPorscheRamRolls-\nRoyceSsangYongSubaruSuzukiTataToyotaVolkswagenVolvo Choose model\n\n__ RECENT ARTICLES\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Aston Martin DBX SUV is what 007 drives when he has kids\n\nAston Martin officially reveals 2020 DBX with 550 horsepower V8 from the\nVantage\n\n__Jose Altoveros\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Mini JCW GP is a 300HP monster hatch\n\nThe most powerful Mini hot hatch to come out of Oxford has 306 HP and a huge\nrear wing\n\n__Marcus De Guzman\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Audi e-Tron Sportback makes electric crossovers look good\n\nAudi’s second electric vehicle – the E-Tron Sportback – officially debuts\n\n__Jose Altoveros\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### All-new 2020 Sentra is what we really want from Nissan PH\n\nWill we call 2020 Nissan Sentra as the Sylphy should it arrive in ASEAN?\n\n__Marcus De Guzman\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Renault to challenge Xpander, Avanza with 7-seat 2020 Triber\n\nRenault's latest seven-seater MPV only measures less than 4 meters long\n\n__Marcus De Guzman\n\n__ POPULAR THIS WEEK\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, G4: This is it\n\nIs Mitsubishi Motors Philippines about to launch the 2020 Mirage (and Mirage\nG4) soon too?\n\n__Anton Andres\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### Hours after reveal, 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage, Mirage G4 get kitted out\n\nLess than a day since its reveal, Mitsubishi already decks out the Mirage\nhatch and Mirage G4\n\n__Anton Andres\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Ford Ranger FX4: coming soon to PH?\n\nLike the previous model, the new Ford Ranger FX4 is two-wheel drive only\n\n__Anton Andres\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### All-new 2020 Sentra is what we really want from Nissan PH\n\nWill we call 2020 Nissan Sentra as the Sylphy should it arrive in ASEAN?\n\n__Marcus De Guzman\n\nAUTO NEWS\n\n##### 2020 Chevrolet Colorado RS isn't what you think it is\n\nChevrolet adds some visual spice to the Colorado with the limited RS model\n\n__Anton Andres\n\n__\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n  * Buyers Guide\n  * Auto News\n  * Car Reviews\n  * Transport & Logistics\n  * Features\n  * Truck & Bus Features\n  * Auto Shows\n  * Inside Man\n  * Editor's Note\n  * Motorsports\n\n* * *\n\nAutoIndustriya.com is the leading automotive resource for the Philippines.\nFeaturing daily headlines and breaking news from the Philippine auto industry\nand around the world.

You’re promised a smooth ride in the\nfastest performance car available; but it would appear that’s not exactly the\ncase. For example, the Google Stadia Red Dead Redemption 2 port doesn’t run at\na solid 60fps.**\n\nPosted on social media by the performance analysts at Digital Foundry, the\nStadia port of Rockstar’s Western video game is not entirely smooth on the\nstreaming service.\n\nThose playing through Stadia’s recommended Chromecast Ultra will be treated to\na 30fps experience in Red Dead Redemption 2. While not ideal for a service\nthat boasts such a high technical makeup, recent impressions appear that the\n30fps lock is at least fairly stable.\n\nIt’s when the Google Stadia Red Dead Redemption 2 port attempts to run at an\nideal 60fps in the Chrome browser where users will run into issues.\nPreliminary tests by Digital Foundry reveal that the game runs at an unstable\nperformance level.\n\nThe group state that the two modes are similar to performance and quality\nmodes on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro. While Chromecast users enjoy the game at a\nreasonably solid 30fps with 4K output, those who play through the Chrome\nbrowser will experience an unstable 1080p 60fps.\n\n> Interesting to see Stadia RDR2 capture out there running at an unstable\n> 60fps. A bit tired here and Stadia barely runs on my home connection right\n> now for some reason, but Saturday night's Chromecast captures are indeed\n> 30fps, while Chrome browser output seem to be aiming for 60.\n> pic.twitter.com/4p7SXk7JPW\n>\n> — Digital Foundry (@digitalfoundry) November 18, 2019\n\nWe recently traveled to Google’s offices in London to try Stadia for\nourselves. We called it “an incredible feat when it decides to work.” It’s\npeak Google.

A spokesperson who did not wish to be named because of agency policy\nsaid in a statement emailed to NBC News that the agency never has administered\nvaccines and people aren't usually held in custody very long.\n\n© Lucy Nicholson Detainees at Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San\nDiego, Calif., on May 18, 2018.\n\n\"As a law enforcement agency and due to the short term nature of CBP holding\nand other logistical challenges, operating a vaccine program is not feasible,\"\nthe spokesperson said.\n\nAlthough CBP’s guidelines recommend holding people no longer than 72 hours,\nthe agency has been holding people far longer as arrivals of migrants seeking\nasylum spiked last year and this year, although they have since fallen.\n\n## \"We write with urgency\"\n\nIn a Nov. 5 letter to Kevin McAleenan, who was the acting director of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security and Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services\nsecretary, said they would provide 100 doses of the influenza vaccines and\nfour volunteer physicians to administer them. McAleenan resigned and Chad Wolf\nhas been named new DHS acting secretary.\n\n\"This is how epidemics begin,\" Dr. Luz Contreras Arroyo, a member of the group\nand signatory to the letter, told NBC News. \"It's not just migrants. Workers\nwill come out to communities, potentially spreading that virus and it could\nget out of control.\"\n\n\"These are people as well,\" Arroyo added, speaking of the detained families.\n\"They are under the care of the government, most not having committed crimes.\nSeeking asylum is not a crime.\"\n\nThe group had set a deadline of Tuesday for the administration to respond\nbefore making the request public.\n\nThe doctors warned that migrants are not the only people at risk of illness.\n\n\"Flu season has already begun in many parts of the country, so we write with\nurgency,\" the doctors stated. \"Many people, including those working at and\nliving near CBP facilities, will be at an even higher risk than what is\ntypical.\"\n\nThe doctors contributed money and raised more from friends and others to pay\nthe cost of the vaccines. Physicians are volunteering their time to provide\nthe shots, said Arroyo, a Sacramento family medicine physician and\npsychiatrist.\n\nThe doctors said they also have an established volunteer network of physicians\nlicensed to operate in all states to get the necessary vaccines and work with\nCBP to “create a system to ensure that the majority of migrant families” held\nin CBP custody are vaccinated.\n\nThey hope for government funding to help pay the cost for vaccines systemwide.\nIf not, they will try to find other funding.\n\n## \"Alarming mortality rate\"\n\nThe doctors said that based on an estimated 200,000 children in federal\ncustody in the past two years, the three deaths of detained children\nattributed to complications from the flu are nine times higher than the\nexpected death rate for children from flu.\n\n“In our professional medical opinion, this alarming mortality rate constitutes\nan emergency which threatens the safety of human lives, particularly\nchildren,” says the letter signed by seven physicians.\n\nIn August, CBP announced that it would not be vaccinating migrant families in\nits holding centers ahead of the flu season. At the time, the agency said in a\nstatement that it chose not to provide the vaccinations because of the “short-\nterm” stays of immigrants in custody and the complexities of operating a\nvaccination program.\n\nBut Arroyo said the government has done wide scale vaccinations before and\ngiven out large amounts of vaccine to prevent illness from spreading and\nprevent epidemics. She said it is cost effective and less than the cost of\nhospitals and ICUs for detainees, staff and residents once they become sick.\n\nCBP's cells and pens of chain-link fence with concrete floors and holding\nrooms are known to be very cold and are often called hieleras, which\ntranslates to freezer or icebox, by those held in them, which include infant\nchildren.\n\nHealth care providers have protested longer detention periods for migrants,\nwarning that children in particular would face more serious health risks with\nthe extended incarcerations.\n\n## Overcrowded conditions worsen risk\n\nThe doctors offering to operate the flu vaccination clinic noted findings of\novercrowded and unsanitary conditions at detention facilities by the DHS\nOffice of Inspector General.\n\nThat report found children in some CBP facilities didn’t have access to\nshowers, didn’t always have opportunities to change clothes and that they had\nlimited space for medical isolation. In an El Paso facility, a cell meant for\n35 held 155 adult males with only one toilet and sink, NBC News reported.\n\nA flu outbreak at the CBP McAllen facility affected nearly three dozen\nimmigrants and required a temporary suspension of operations.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control recommends all individuals above age 6 months\nget a flu vaccine by the end of October for the current flu season. Even the\npolicy manual of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the\nHomeland Security Department, notes the CDC requirement that immigrants be\nvaccinated for flu.\n\n“As physicians, we have seen the effects of flu infections in the strongest as\nwell as the most vulnerable, and the outcomes can be devastating,” the\nphysicians stated.\n\n ** _FollowNBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram._**\n\nRead More\n\nMicrosoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through\nrecommended links in this article.\n\nAdChoices\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * 5\n\n#### YOU MAY LIKE\n\nAd Microsoft\n\n  * 24 Discounts Seniors Are Entitled To\n\niLoveRetirement\n\n  * Jaw-Dropping Card Offers 0% Interest Until 2021\n\nThe Ascent\n\n  * Forget Amazon; Here’s a Better Stock to Buy\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\n##  More from NBC News\n\n  * ### Analysis: A damaging day of impeachment hearings for Donald Trump\n\n  * ### State Department asked to probe top diplomats' use of personal cell phones\n\n  * ### New York college student, 20, falls to death while hiking\n\nVisit site\n\nAdChoices\n\nFeedback\n\n  * © 2019 Microsoft\n\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * Terms of use\n  * \n\n  * About our Ads\n  * Help\n  * Newsletter\n  * MSN Worldwide\n  * MSN Blog\n  * About Us\n  * Editorial Standards\n\n  *   * \n\n  *   * \n\n## Found the story interesting?\n\nLike us on Facebook to see similar stories\n\nI'm already a fan, don't show this again  \n\n## Send MSN Feedback\n\n## We appreciate your input!\n\nHow can we improve?\n\nPlease give an overall site rating:\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\nSubmit Close\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\nHelp\n\nHelp & Support\n\nClose\n\n## Make MSN my homepage\n\n  * On the toolbar, click Safari.

After all, we\nshould be humble and give the driver some amount of credit, before we decide\nthat we know better than them and say that they are stupidly doing something\nthat’s not in their own best interest.\n\nLogically, there must be some speed at which it’s no longer better (in terms\nof overall utility) to be slower — if not, the speed limit would be 1 MPH. Are\nwe sure that those buses are currently travelling above that ideal speed?\n\n  * **Gary M** on September 17, 2018 at 8:50 pm said: \n\nHave you written anything about the trade-off between giving now vs investing\nthe money and giving in the future?  \nIn particular it seems like effective altruism research is still improving\nquickly, so we might be able to give more effectively in the future.\n\n  * **Catherine (GiveWell)** on September 19, 2018 at 12:48 pm said: \n\nHi Alex,\n\nOur best guess is that any effects on vehicle speed are fairly small. We have\nlimited data on this question; the only information we have is from the 2015\nrandomized controlled trial (RCT). We write in our report on Zusha!:\n\n> In Habyarimana & Jack 2015, the authors try to test mechanisms, but the\n> evidence is mixed. There is no significant difference in reports of reckless\n> driving or passenger complaints between the treatment and control vehicles.\n> There is also no significant difference in maximum moving speeds. However,\n> the average moving speed was slower for treatment vehicles than control\n> vehicles, by about 1 km/h on average.\n\nReductions in average speed at levels similar to that referenced above are\nsmall enough that we don’t model the disutility. That said, this study raises\nthe question of the mechanism by which accidents are reduced, if speeds don’t\nchange. Our question about the mechanism by which the reduction in accidents\noccurred is one of our key uncertainties about the program, and is one of the\nfactors that led us to discount our best-guess effect of the intervention more\nthan for most programs with RCTs we’ve looked at.\n\n  * **Catherine (GiveWell)** on September 20, 2018 at 10:07 am said: \n\nHi Gary,\n\nWe detailed several considerations related to giving now versus later in this\n2011 blog post.\n\nWe see the following general arguments in favor of giving now and giving\nlater.\n\nIn favor of giving now:  \n* It may become less cost-effective to help people in the future, due to general economic development and improvements in living conditions, and so some of the best opportunities to save or improve a life today may not exist in the future.  \n* Accomplishing good today may “earn interest,” by empowering people and positioning them to help others in the future.\n\nIn favor of giving later:  \n* We might find more cost-effective programs in the future, through our Incubation Grants program or by researching and reviewing new areas, such as policy advocacy.  \n* An opportunity that looks good now could look worse in the future (for example, because we learn new information or because it runs out of room for more funding).\n\nOn balance, our best guess is that the benefits of giving now are likely to\noutweigh the benefits of giving later, although we have a high degree of\nuncertainty around this. Some of the additional factors raised in the 2011\nblog post also point in favor of giving now, such as providing an incentive to\nthink carefully about where to give each year and helping charities plan\naround your gifts.\n\nIn addition, here are some resources outside of GiveWell from the effective\naltruism community that may be of interest in thinking about this question:  \n* Effective Altruism Forum roundup of writings on this topic  \n* 2015 Global Priorities Project write-up, with flowchart\n\n  * **Mohammad** on September 29, 2018 at 12:16 am said: \n\nHi,  \nI recently stumbled upon this old blog post\n(https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2012/12/some-general-concerns-about-\ngivewell/) by William MacAskill and was very interested in this remark:\n\n“GoodVentures’ endowment could easily use up the room for more funding at\nGiveWell’s top charities. So it raises the question why GoodVentures doesn’t\ndonate to GiveWell’s top charities: even if not exhausting their room for more\nfunding, at least using up a considerable proportion of it. The most plausible\nexplanation in my mind is that GiveWell thinks that GoodVentures can better\nspend its money at a later date after further research. In which case, it’s\nhard to see why individual donors shouldn’t save and donate later, or even try\nto give to GoodVentures. Perhaps that’s wrong, but it’s worthy of discussion.”\n\nI wanted to know if there had been any further discussion on it by GiveWell or\nothers. If there hasn’t, could GiveWell give a response now? Is the reason\nGoodVentures is not exhausting its funds to close these gaps every year\nbecause they are holding out for a future opportunity? Or is it to\nstrategically leave behind some funding gaps so as to entice individiual\ndonors like myself who are attracted to effectiveness, and thus in the grand\nscheme of things there will have been moved a greater sum of money in\ntotality?\n\n  * **Olivia (GiveWell)** on October 4, 2018 at 10:58 am said: \n\nHi Mohammad,\n\nThanks for your question.\n\nGood Ventures is a large charitable foundation which works closely with\nGiveWell, although the two organizations are distinct from one another. Good\nVentures sets its overall grantmaking budget independent from GiveWell,\naccording to its own cause prioritization. In 2017, Good Ventures’ giving to\nGiveWell’s top charities derived from its assumption that, in the long run,\n10% of its total available capital would go to “straightforward charity” (as\nopposed to more speculative causes or worldviews), expected to align with\nGiveWell’s research and recommendations. You can read about the reasoning for\nGood Ventures choosing 10% in detail here.\n\nGiveWell was involved in discussions with Good Ventures about the allocation\nof this pool of its funding in 2017, but, as we noted in our blog post\nannouncing our updated top charities, “the amount [Good Ventures gave to our\nrecommended charities] was based on discussions about how to allocate funding\nacross time and across cause areas. It was not set based on the total size of\ntop charities’ funding gaps or the projection of what others would give.”\n\n  * **Charles Pritchard** on October 27, 2018 at 8:34 pm said: \n\nHave there been any further discussions or analyses performed in relation to\nthe Partners in Health programs following the 2012 update?\n\nhttps://www.givewell.org/international/charities/PIH\n\n  * **Catherine (GiveWell)** on October 29, 2018 at 12:06 pm said: \n\nHi Charles,\n\nWe have not prioritized further investigation into Partners in Health since\nour 2012 review was published.\n\nComments are closed.\n\nfacebook twitter print email\n\n## Recent Blog Posts\n\nWant to stay updated on GiveWell's research?

Funding for\nIncubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we\nwork closely.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis post will discuss the following:\n\n  * Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More) \n  * Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More) \n  * Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (More) \n\n### Incubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\n\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\n> A key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-\n> backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem\n> potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there\n> is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This\n> grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on\n> interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but\n> that lack existing organizations to scale them.\n>\n> We have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most\n> important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through\n> partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the\n> potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and\n> scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top\n> charities.\n>\n> We believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the\n> nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially\n> scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator\nbecause of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-\nquality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence\nAction, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No\nLean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\n#### Modeling cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made\nexplicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this\ngrant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this\nsection, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s\ncost-effectiveness.\n\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top\ncharities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than\nalternatives could.\n\nThis could occur:\n\n  1. if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or \n  2. if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level. \n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders\nto allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may\ncreate programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If\nthese new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would\nhave otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by\ncausing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never\nrecommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not\nbecause we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and\ncommunicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a\n55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by\nDecember 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to\nwhich we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the\ngrant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts\nwe made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above\nin our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential\nupside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could\nchange substantially with additional research.\n\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as\ncash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly\nuncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-\neffectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-\neffective as cash transfers.\n\n### Risks to the success of the grant\n\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\n  * Few programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact. \n  * We expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused. \n\n### Going forward\n\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we\nmight contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in\nthe future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing\npartnership and follow this work closely.\n\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n\nPosted in GiveWell Incubation Grants | Permalink | 1 Comment\n\n  * Previous Post\n  * Next Post\n\n### Comments\n\n  * **Jamie Cassidy** on November 15, 2018 at 10:12 am said: \n\nI am so pumped about this!

The fight for African American voters\nis raging. And there are growing concerns that impeachment may become a\ndistraction from the primary. Those issues and more will play out Wednesday\nnight when the Democratic Party’s top 10 face off in Atlanta just 75 days\nbefore primary voting begins.\n\nSeven big questions heading into the debate, to be carried on MSNBC:\n\nWHO IS THE FRONT-RUNNER?\n\nTurbulent polling across the early voting states has created a murky picture\nof the top tier of the 2020 class. As much as Joe Biden is still a front-\nrunner, so are Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. The\nquestion is who gets the front-runner treatment in Wednesday’s debate. Warren\nwas under near-constant attack last month as a new leader. Will Warren\ncontinue to face the heat, or will the ascendant Buttigieg or weakening Biden\ntake more hits?\n\n___\n\nHOW WILL OBAMA PLAY?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, the most popular Democrat in America, inserted\nhimself into the 2020 primary in recent days by warning candidates against\nmoving too far to the left. His comments create a challenge for Warren and\nSanders and an opening for moderates Buttigieg, Biden and Amy Klobuchar to\nattack. At the same time, Obama’s involvement offers a powerful reminder of\nthe massive role African Americans will play in the presidential nomination\nprocess. As we know, all candidates not named Biden have serious work to do\nwhen it comes to winning over the black vote. Race and Obama’s legacy could\nplay a major role in shaping the action.\n\n___\n\nWHAT SAY YOU, IMPEACHMENT JURY?\n\nThey have all come out in favor of impeachment — some more aggressively than\nothers — but it’s noteworthy that five of the 10 Democrats on stage will serve\nas jurors in the Senate impeachment trial should the House vote to impeach\nPresident Donald Trump. It’s a complicated topic for Democrats. Some senators\nworry that a prospective impeachment trial will interfere with their ability\nto court voters early next year. Others fear that impeachment could hurt their\nparty’s more vulnerable candidates in down-ballot elections next year. Either\nway, what the prospective jurors do or don’t say on the debate stage could be\nrelevant if and when the Senate holds an impeachment trial, which is\nincreasingly likely.\n\n___\n\nWILL THEY BASH THE BILLIONAIRES?\n\nNever before has wealth been under such aggressive attack in a presidential\nprimary election. And with one billionaire onstage and another likely to join\nthe field in the coming days, the billionaire bashing could reach new heights.\nTom Steyer has largely gone under the radar, but the even wealthier Michael\nBloomberg has generated tremendous buzz as he steps toward a run of his own.\nOf the two, only Steyer will be on stage, but expect Bloomberg’s shadow in\nparticular to generate passionate arguments about wealth and the role of money\nin politics.\n\n___\n\nWILL SOMEONE STAND UP FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT?\n\nBiden continues to be the favorite of many establishment Democrats, but his\nunderwhelming candidacy has created an opening for another pragmatic-minded\nDemocrat to step up. That’s why former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and\nBloomberg are moving into the race. Buttigieg stepped aggressively into the\nestablishment lane in the last debate, but many donors and elected officials\nremain skeptical of the 37-year-old small-city mayor’s chances. The\nopportunity is there for lower-tier candidates including Kamala Harris,\nKlobuchar and Steyer.\n\n___\n\nDOES SHE HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT?\n\nNo single issue has dominated the initial Democratic primary debates more than\nhealth care, and it’s safe to assume that will be the case again Wednesday\nnight. And no one has more riding on that specific debate than Warren, who\nhurt herself last month by stumbling through questions about the cost of her\nsingle-payer health care plan. Given that policy specifics make up the\nbackbone of her candidacy, she can’t afford another underwhelming performance\non the defining policy debate of the primary season. Expect the policy-minded\nsenator to have a new strategy this time around.\n\n___\n\nCAN THEY SAVE THEMSELVES?\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Andrew\nYang and Steyer are under enormous pressure to break out given their status as\nthe only candidates onstage who haven’t yet qualified for the December debate.\nThey likely won’t have the same number of opportunities to speak as their\nhigher-polling rivals, but these are dire times for the underdogs. They need\nto do something if they expect to stay relevant in the 2020 conversation.\n\n___\n\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics\npodcast, “Ground Game.”\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 1\n\n#####  This Bay Area zip code ranks as the most expensive in the country\n\n  * 2\n\n#####  Witness cheered for correcting Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan\n\n  * 3\n\n#####  For years, people pinned dollar bills to the ceiling of Alameda bar.\nWhy they finally took them down\n\n  * 4\n\n#####  Fodor's puts Big Sur on its do not travel list for 2020\n\n  * 5\n\n#####  BART confirms fatality aboard one of its trains\n\n  * 6\n\n#####  Trump press secretary faces backlash over claim that Obama aides left\n'you will fail' notes\n\n  * 7\n\n#####  Letter shows psychologist broke rules with Iowa sex predator\n\n  * 8\n\n#####  Man Shot While Standing In Front Of Outer Mission Home Early Tuesday\n\n  * 9\n\n#####  Here's where PG&E blackouts will start Wednesday\n\n  * 10\n\n#####  PG&E hasn't confirmed precise outage timing.

The plan also aims to\nreach module efficiencies of around 24% – up to 35% for multi-junction cells –\nby the end of the next decade.\n\nNovember 20, 2019 Emiliano Bellini\n\n  * Markets \n  * Modules & Upstream Manufacturing \n  * Policy \n  * Utility-scale PV \n  * South Korea \n\nHanwha Q Cells was reportedly South Korea’s largest cell maker at the end of\n2017, with 3.7 GW of annual production capacity.\n\n _Image: Hanwha Q cells_\n\n#### Share\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has unveiled a\nplan to help the PV industry further reduce the costs of solar module\ntechnology and to increase product efficiency.\n\nThe initiative is part of the Fourth Energy Technology Development Plan and\nRoadmap, submitted to Korean renewable energy industry representatives this\nweek. The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-\nfired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind\npower projects, among other measures.\n\nSixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap\ninclude a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10\nby 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way\nof rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in\n2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large\nscale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of\nEnergy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved\nthree years early.\n\n **Module efficiency**\n\nThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar\nmodule efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade.\nSeoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-\njunction devices from 23% to 35%.\n\nNo details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would\nbe achieved.\n\nThe plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which\naimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency\nlevels and industrial standards for solar and wind power. Those planned\nguidelines are yet to see the light of day.\n\n **Domestic industry**\n\nA recent report by the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power\nSystems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual\nproduction capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had\n3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point\nand LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and\nmodules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production\noperations ranging from 30-600 MW.\n\nHowever, the reduction in demand seen after Beijing attempted to rein in\npublic solar subsidies at the end of May last year ensures some of that 8.69\nGW of Korean production lines may have since been idled or closed altogether.\n\nSouth Korea also hosts several polysilicon manufacturers, including the OCI\nGroup and Hanwha Q Cells parent Hanwha Group. That industry too is suffering\nfrom oversupply and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports by the Chinese\ngovernment since July 2013.\n\nDespite the manufacturing setbacks introduced by its regional neighbor and\nsolar giant, South Korea is seeing stronger than ever solar project\ndeployment. According to data released by MOTIE in August, newly installed\ncapacity for the first seven months of the year reached 1.64 GW and Seoul\nplans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. That ambitious target is expected\nto be achieved with giant solar parks such as a recently announced 2.1 GW\nfloating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array planned in the\nSaemangeum area and announced by president Moon Jae-in a year ago.\n\n#### Share\n\n#### Emiliano Bellini\n\nEmiliano joined pv magazine in March 2017.

Só as almas nobres dotadas de sensibilidade divina\nconseguem ser gratas à vida mesmo …\n\n## Temas\n\n  * Mensagens de Bom Dia\n  * Mensagens de Reflexão da Vida\n  * Feliz Aniversário\n  * Mensagens de Boa Noite\n  * Mensagem de Autoestima\n  * Mensagem de Motivação\n  * Mensagem para Marido\n  * Mensagens Bíblicas\n  * Mensagens de Boa Tarde\n  * Mensagens de Fé\n  * Mensagem de Superação\n  * Mensagens de Amizade\n  * Mensagens de Otimismo\n  * Mensagens de Deus\n  * Quem Sou Eu\n  * Reflexão Lição de Vida\n  * Mensagens de Amor\n  * Mensagens de Decepção\n  * Mensagens Evangélicas\n  * Agradecimento a Deus\n  * Mensagem de Sabedoria\n  * Mensagens Tristes\n  * Mensagens para Namorado\n  * Mensagens de Paz\n  * Mensagens de Humildade\n  * Mensagens de Felicidade\n  * Mensagens de Boa Noite Amor\n  * Mensagens de Boa Tarde Amiga\n  * Mensagens de Amor Verdadeiro\n  * Feliz Dezembro\n  * Seja Bem-Vindo Dezembro\n\n## Natal e Ano Novo\n\n  * Mensagem de Natal\n  * Feliz Natal Amigos!\n  * Mensagem Evangélica de Natal\n  * Feliz Natal Amor\n  * Oração de Natal\n  * Texto de Natal\n  * Mensagem de Natal para Namorado\n  * Mensagem de Feliz Natal para Clientes\n  * Feliz Natal e Próspero Ano Novo\n  * Mensagem de Ano Novo\n\n© 2019 Mensagens de Reflexão  \n\n  * Contato\n  * Categorias\n\n"

(AP)\n\nBreaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President\nDonald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening\ntrade war.\n\n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great\nbetrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019.\n\"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions\nand billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\n\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more\ncompetitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the\nthinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better.\nThose workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread\nthose dollars around the economy more broadly.\n\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job\nlosses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the\nAlliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of\nTrump’s tariff decisions.\n\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary\nvictims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while\ntariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across\nthe economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any\nslowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the\nbroader U.S. economy.\n\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a\nprofessor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like\nany tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the\ntrading relationship poorer — not richer.\"\n\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger\nfraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse\nthan more affluent Americans do.\n\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the\nUnited States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the\nworld.\n\nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\n\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that\nmake the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\n\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S.\nCustoms and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a\nU.S. importer — say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban\nInstitute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \"The Chinese\ngovernment pays nothing.\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of\ntheir shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay\ntheir amount by that date are sent a new bill.\n\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable\nrather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are\nhigh enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S.\nconsumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for\nInternational Economics.\n\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are\nused to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price\nincreases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that\nU.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a\nsuitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower\nquality.\n\nDon’t tariffs produce revenue?\n\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through\nJune 30, 2019.\n\nThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs.\nFor context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\n\nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by\nretaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two\nyears.\n\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\n\nAs we’ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research,\na London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods,\n\"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a\nreduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\n\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era\ntariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by\n2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on\neconomic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political\nscientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\n\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax\nFoundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump\nadministration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while\nlowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent\njobs.\n\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too.\nFacing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer\nChinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product.\n\nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\n\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed\nby steel and aluminum in March 2018.\n\nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery,\nfollowed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics,\nmore machinery, and electrical equipment.\n\nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018,\naffecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods.\nTariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the\nlist of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes,\nshoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices.\n\nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including\nmany food products.\n\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a\nwide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade\nPartnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington.\n\nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts\nfrom tariffs?\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers.\n\nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from\n$19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau\nFederation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the\nfirst half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may\nhave had an impact as well.)\n\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker\nWinnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the\ntariffs.\n\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely,\na Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S.\nare computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\n\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps,\nand semiconductors, have seen price increases, harming U.S. producers. \"When\nthe price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete\nagainst non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### About this article\n\nResearchers: Louis Jacobson\n\nNames in this article: Donald Trump\n\n### Sources:\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"The Effects of Tariffs and Trade Barriers in\nCBO’s Projections,\" Aug. 22, 2019\n\nTax Foundation, \"Tracking the Economic Impact of U.S. Tariffs and Retaliatory\nActions,\" May 31, 2019\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics, \"The Cost of Another US-China\nNo-Deal Deal,\" Oct. 15, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Board, \"Beige Book,\" Oct. 16, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, \"Inflationary Effects of Trade Disputes\nwith China,\" Feb. 25, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, CPI historical data, accessed Nov. 5, 2019\n\nCNN, \"China exempts US soybeans and pork from tariffs,\" Sept. 13, 2019\n\nWall Street Journal, \"U.S. Collected $63 Billion in Tariffs Through June,\"\nAug. 7, 2019\n\nPolitiFact, \"Donald Trump says tariffs will make America rich again.\nEconomists disagree,\" Dec. 17, 2018\n\nPolitiFact, \"In shot at Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is correct about\ntariffs' role in Great Depression,\" June 6, 2016\n\nPolitiFact, \"Who pays for US tariffs on Chinese goods?

The man was subsequently quarantined after the\ndiagnosis, along with 28 people who he came into contact with.\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * Plague outbreak: China hit by ‘highly contagious’ pneumonic plague\n  * Horror as plague of killer mosquitos are headed to Britain\n\nHowever, the other 28 people have showed no signs or symptoms of the plague.\n\nThe other two contractors caught pneumonic plague, with the difference being\nbubonic effects the lymph nodes whereas pneumonic effects the lungs.\n\nFan Mengguang, deputy director of Inner Mongolia’s disease prevention and\ncontrol centre, told the media that the latest case is “isolated and\nunrelated” to the cases in Beijing.\n\nHowever, with three confirmed diagnoses, the public is beginning to panic over\na potential outbreak.\n\nYersina pestis causes the plague (Image: GETTY)\n\nThe plague wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century (Image: GETTY)\n\nAccording to AFP, one user on Weibo, which is essentially China’s version of\nTwitter, posted: “I just want to know how these two came to Beijing?? By\ntrain, airplane, or did they drive themselves?”\n\nAnother reportedly said: ”Bird flu in the year of the rooster... swine fever\nin the year of the pig. Next year is the year of the rat...the plague is\ncoming.”\n\nThe pneumonic plague is just one of three diseases caused by the Yersinia\npestis bacterium.\n\nPneumonic plague is known for its effects on the respiratory system, as it\ncauses dangerous lung infections.\n\n **READ MORE:China plague outbreak confirmed: Two diagnosed with disease in\nBeijing**\n\nPlague can be easily vaccinated (Image: GETTY)\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * UK weather alert: Plague of mosquitos to devastate Britain as Hurri...\n  * Bible bombshell: Scientists claim discovery of root of all evil\n\nYersinia pestis also causes bubonic plague - otherwise known as the ‘black\ndeath - which affects lymph nodes, and septicemic plague, which affects the\nblood.\n\nOf the three plague variants, pneumonic is the most virulent and is fatal if\nleft untreated.\n\nIn the 14th century the Black Death spread across the Mediterranean and\nEurope, killing up to 60 percent of Europe’s total population.\n\nMore than 100 million people may have perished - reducing the world population\nfrom an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million.\n\n **DON'T MISS**  \n **Plague and zoonotic influenza warning: CDC names EIGHT deadly diseases\n[WARNING]**  \n **BLACK DEATH PLAGUE fears: Holidaymakers die after eating marmot [INSIGHT]**  \n **Plane passengers quarantined after BUBONIC PLAGUE outbreak [NEWS]**\n\nA 14th century plague doctor (Image: GETTY)\n\nAccording to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the US, the plague is\ntreatable with antibiotics.\n\nThe CDC advises the earlier people seek treatment, the more likely it is they\nwill make a full recovery.\n\nThose who come into close contact with plague victims may need preventative\nantibiotic therapy.\n\n### Trending\n\nIn the 21st century, the plague is endemic to select regions of the planet.\n\nThree countries where the plague still circulates are the Democratic Republic\nof Congo (DRC), Madagascar, and Peru.\n\nIsolated cases often also spring up in the US, with up to a dozen people\ndiagnosed annually.\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * Major health warning issued after DEADLY PLAGUE confirmed in wild a...\n  * Plague blamed on Madagascar ritual of digging up dead relatives\n  * Major cities face plague of vicious bloodthirsty SUPER-RATS\n\nChina\n\n### Most read in Science\n\n### Latest videos\n\n#### UK weather forecast: Terrifying map shows COLLAPSED polar vortex freezing\nUK in December\n\n#### Flights: Passengers can fly for up to 80 percent less by travelling on\nthis day\n\n#### Royal wedding 2020: Will Princess Beatrice be allowed to wear a royal\ntiara?\n\n#### Queen and Prince Philip spend 72nd wedding anniversary apart after health\nconcerns\n\n#### Rachel Riley: ‘It really matters’ Susie Dent speaks out on Countdown co-\nstar's role\n\n#### Archeology news: Major discovery sparks bidding war after ancient ring\nunearthed\n\n#### NASA Moon landing: How Apollo 12 faced a catastrophic failure seconds\nafter launch TWICE\n\n#### Elon Musk’s SpaceX begins testing on groundbreaking Starship rocket to\nget humans to Mars\n\n#### Meteor shower 2019: 'Few hundred' meteors are about to burst out in\ndazzling rare display\n\n#### Life on Mars: Ohio University expert finds 'evidence' of alien bugs in\nNASA's rover photos\n\n#### Lucky fossil hunter finds prehistoric sea creature inside ‘golden snitch’\non English coast\n\n#### NASA shock discovery: Supermassive blackhole creating stars at a ‘furious\nrate’ found\n\n#### Asteroid swarm: NASA tracks three large space rocks barreling towards\nEarth tomorrow\n\n#### Asteroid warning: NASA reveals 10 dates 'God of chaos' asteroid Apophis\ncould hit Earth\n\n#### NASA shock: Veteran astronaut reveals what North Korea really looks like\nfrom space\n\n#### Life after death: Scientist explains what ACTUALLY happens when you die -\nVIDEO\n\n#### Black hole shock: New method to explore black holes explained -\n‘harnessing its symphony’\n\n#### Alien life bombshell: Exoplanet study offers a glimmer of hope we are not\nalone in space\n\n#### Reality is subjective to the observer -

The layoffs are part of an effort by the\nstruggling office-space company to cut costs, close ancillary businesses and\nnarrow its offering to subletting office space.\n\nWeWork chairman Marcelo Claure (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn a company email sent by chairman Marcelo Claure, employees were told that\nlayoffs will begin this week in the U.S., and that a planned all-hands meeting\nwill be postponed from Tuesday to Friday, where Claure will present the\ncompany’s five-year plan.\n\n“In the areas of the business that do not directly support our core business\ngoals, we have to make some necessary job eliminations,” Claure said in the\nemail, which was seen by _The Real Deal_. “We are going to eliminate and scale\nback certain functions and responsibilities, which will increase efficiency\nand also accountability.”\n\nA person familiar with the matter told _TRD_ that employees in the legal and\nhuman resources departments will begin receiving notice Monday.\n\nWeWork declined to comment.\n\nWeWork employees have waited weeks to hear notice of the layoffs, since the\ncompany abandoned plans for an IPO and had its valuation slashed from $47\nbillion to $8 billion. After CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann left the company\nin October, SoftBank, its largest investor, committed to a $9.5 billion\nlifeline to bail out the company, and installed a Claure to implement a\nturnaround strategy.\n\nIn sum, more than 4,000 people are expected to receive notice in the coming\nweeks, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n\nThose include 1,000 maintenance workers who have been informed that their\nemployment will be terminated on Dec. 9, according to a group of employees.\nThe group, WeWorkers Coalition, formed in recent weeks and sent a letter to\nmanagement earlier this month stating that they “don’t want to be defined by\nthe scandals, the corruption and the greed exhibited by the company’s\nleadership.”\n\nThe group announced over the weekend that WeWork had reached an agreement with\nJLL to accept close to 1,000 maintenance and cleaning workers, many of whom\nwould then be contracted to work in WeWork buildings.\n\nHowever, the group raised alarm at the terms of the deal, and said that\nemployees were told by WeWork to sign the terms of the contract by Monday,\notherwise it would consider their resignations voluntary. The group said on\nTwitter that the contract has confused employees with pay discrepancies, and\ndemanded a deadline extension.\n\nIn a separate tweet, the group added that WeWork “is not following through on\nits promise to treat employees with ‘dignity and respect’ during this\nrestructuring process.”\n\nMany employees and shareholders with stock options are also waiting to hear\nwhen a $3 billion tender offer by SoftBank will be launched, after being\ndelayed for almost two weeks.\n\n* * *\n\n__Share on Facebook __Share on Twitter __Share on Linkedin __Share via Email\n__Share via Shortlink\n\nShare via Shortlink\n\n##### Tags\n\nWeWork\n\n### Popular\n\n  1.

A\n43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling\nextreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet\nlung,\" according to a new case report.\n\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained\nmalaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a\nlower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit\nafter that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days\noff work.\n\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness,\nsuch as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to\nbed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and\nthen needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was\nsigned off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\n **Related:** _ **7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction**_\n\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be\nnormal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal\nInfirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed\nCT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic\nreaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather\nbedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a\ncompound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was\ndiagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung\ninflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the\nbody's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air\nsacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we\nrealize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of\nhypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust\nfrom hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is\nsawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic\nsynthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six\nmonths he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and\nhe is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\"\nthe patient wrote in the case study.\n\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\"\nof the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the\nenvironment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is\n\"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated\nunnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't\npanic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as\ncough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know,\nhe added.\n\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal _BMJ Case Reports_.\n\n  *  _27 Oddest Medical Case Reports_\n  *  _10 Strangest Medical Cases_\n  *  _11 Weird Things People Have Swallowed_\n\n _Originally published on_ _ _Live Science__ _._\n\n _Want more science?

By “tasting” the presence of certain pathogens, these\ncells may act as sentinels for the immune system.\n\nRenderBurger for Quanta Magazine\n\n### Carrie Arnold\n\n _Contributing Writer_\n\n* * *\n\n _November 15, 2019_\n\n* * *\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologycell biologyimmunology\n\nWhen the immunologist De’Broski Herbert at the University of Pennsylvania\nlooked deep inside the lungs of mice infected with influenza, he thought he\nwas seeing things. He had found a strange-looking cell with a distinctive\nthatch of projections like dreadlocks atop a pear-shaped body, and it was\nstudded with taste receptors. He recalled that it looked just like a tuft cell\n— a cell type most often associated with the lining of the intestines.\n\nBut what would a cell covered with taste receptors be doing in the lungs? And\nwhy did it only appear there in response to a severe bout of influenza?\n\nHerbert wasn’t alone in his puzzlement over this mysterious and little-studied\ngroup of cells that keep turning up in unexpected places, from the thymus (a\nsmall gland in the chest where pathogen-fighting T cells mature) to the\npancreas. Scientists are only just beginning to understand them, but it is\ngradually becoming clear that tuft cells are an important hub for the body’s\ndefenses precisely because they can communicate with the immune system and\nother sets of tissues, and because their taste receptors allow them to\nidentify threats that are still invisible to other immune cells.\n\nResearchers around the world are tracing the ancient evolutionary roots that\nolfactory and taste receptors (collectively called chemosensory receptors or\nnutrient receptors) share with the immune system. A flurry of work in recent\nyears shows that their paths cross far more often than anyone anticipated, and\nthat this chemosensory-immunological network plays a role not just in\ninfection, but in cancer and at least a handful of other diseases.\n\nThis system, says Richard Locksley, an immunologist at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, helps direct a systematic response to potential\ndangers throughout the body. Research focusing on the interactions of the tuft\ncell could offer a glimpse of how organ systems work together. He describes\nthe prospects of what could come from the studies of these receptors and cells\nas “exciting,” but cautions that “we’re still in the very early days” of\nfiguring it out.\n\n## Not Merely Taste and Smell Receptors\n\nOne of life’s fundamental challenges is to find food that’s good to eat and\navoid food that isn’t. Outside of our modern world of prepackaged food on\ngrocery store shelves, it’s a perilous task. Taking advantage of a new type of\nfood could mean the difference between starvation and survival, or it could\nmean an early death from accidental self-poisoning. Chemosensory receptors\nhelp us make this distinction. They’re so essential that even single-celled\nbacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ carry a type of this receptor.\n\nDespite the near universality of these receptors and their centrality to\nsurvival, scientists didn’t discover the big family of genes that encode for\nolfactory receptors until 1991, with the ones for taste receptors following in\n2000. (The olfactory receptor discovery brought the researchers Richard Axel\nand Linda Buck a Nobel Prize in 2004.) Olfactory receptors and taste receptors\nfor bitter, sweet and umami (savory) are all part of a large family of\nproteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are embedded in cell\nmembranes. Although the precise details vary from receptor to receptor, when a\nGPCR binds to the proper molecule, it sets off a signaling cascade within the\ncell. For taste and olfactory receptors in the mouth and nose, this cascade\ncauses neurons to fire and enables us to recognize everything from the rich\nsweetness of a chocolate chip cookie to the nose-wrinkling stench of a passing\nskunk.\n\nThe discoveries of these receptors were momentous, groundbreaking advances,\nsays Jennifer Pluznick, a physiologist at Johns Hopkins University. But in her\nview, labeling them as olfactory and taste receptors rather than as\nchemosensory receptors entrenched the idea that they function specifically and\nexclusively in smell and taste. If scientists found signs of these receptors\nin cells outside the nose and mouth, it was easy to write them off as mistakes\nor anomalies. She herself was shocked to find an olfactory receptor called\nOlfr78 in kidney cells, a finding that she reported in 2009.\n\n### Share this article\n\n###### Copied!\n\n* * *\n\n### Newsletter\n\n _Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox_\n\nSubscribe now\n\nMost recent newsletter\n\n **Video:** In this talk presented at the 2016 TEDMED conference, Jennifer\nPluznick, an associate professor of physiology at Johns Hopkins University,\ndiscusses the diverse function of the scent detectors found in tissues\nthroughout the body.\n\nTEDMED\n\n“I think I even famously said something to my postdoc adviser, like, ‘I don’t\neven know that I can trust this data, you know?’” Pluznick recalled.\n“Olfactory receptors in the kidney? Come on.”\n\nThis wasn’t the first time these receptors had shown up in unexpected tissues.\nFor example, in 2005, the University of Liverpool biochemist Soraya Shirazi-\nBeechey showed in a paper published in _Biochemical Society Transactions_ that\ntaste receptors could be found in the small intestine as well as the mouth.\nTheir presence was surprising, but it made a certain sense that the intestine\nmight use a taste receptor to monitor the food it was digesting.\n\nBut then in 2010, the laboratory of Stephen Liggett, who was then at the\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine, reported that smooth muscle in the\nairways of the lungs expresses receptors for bitter taste. Moreover, they\nshowed that these receptors were involved in a dilation response of the\nairways that helped to clear out obstructions.\n\nReceptors for sweetness also turned up on the cells lining the airways. In\n2012, a research group led by Herbert’s colleague Noam Cohen at the University\nof Pennsylvania found that the sugars coating the respiratory pathogen\n_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ activated those receptors and caused the cells to\nbeat their hairlike cilia more rapidly, a process that can sweep away invading\nbacteria and prevent infections.\n\nMeanwhile, Pluznick and her colleagues had continued to study the role of the\nOlfr78 receptor in the kidneys. They demonstrated in 2013 that it responded to\nmolecules secreted by intestinal microorganisms, and that signals from that\nresponse helped to direct the kidney’s secretion of the hormone renin, which\nregulates blood pressure. “Other labs finding similar things in other tissues\nwas both very encouraging and very exciting,” Pluznick said.\n\nThese studies and a torrent of others from labs around the world drove home\nthe message that these seemingly misplaced olfactory and taste receptors serve\nimportant and often vital functions. And a theme common to many of those\nfunctions was that the chemosensory receptors often seemed to be alerting\ntissues to the presence and condition of microbes in the body. In hindsight,\nthat application for the receptors made a lot of sense. For example, as\nHerbert notes, being able to “taste” and “smell” minute traces of pathogens\ngives the body more chances to respond to infections before microbes overwhelm\nthe host’s defenses.\n\n## A Job for Tuft Cells\n\nIn researchers’ assays for chemosensory receptors in tissues throughout the\nbody, a cell type that kept popping up was a relatively rare, largely\nunstudied one called a tuft cell. Tuft cells had been known to science since\nthe mid-1950s, when microscopy studies found them in the lining of practically\nevery organ in the body, including the gut, the lungs, the nasal passages, the\npancreas and the gallbladder. The passage of a half-century, however, hadn’t\nled to any greater understanding of what tuft cells do. The further discovery\nof taste receptors on many tuft cells only deepened the mystery: Given their\nlocations in the body, they certainly weren’t contributing to our sense of\ntaste.\n\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the lab of Wendy Garrett in 2011,\nMichael Howitt became fascinated with tuft cells, especially those found in\nthe intestines. “They were these really intriguing, weird cells that didn’t\nreally have a clear function in terms of the normal physiology,” said Howitt,\nwho is now an immunologist at Stanford University. He set out to learn the\nenigmatic cells’ function, and he eventually got his answer — through an\nunexpected discovery involving the mouse microbiome.\n\nBecause some studies had hinted at a link between taste receptors and immune\nfunction, Howitt wondered whether the receptor-studded tuft cells in the\nintestines might respond to the microbiome population of bacteria living in\nthe gut. To find out, he turned to a strain of mice that other Harvard\nresearchers had bred to lack a wide variety of bacterial pathogens.\n\nBut surprisingly, when he inspected a small sample of intestinal tissue from\nthe mice, Howitt found that they had 18 times the number of tuft cells\npreviously reported. When he looked more closely, he found that the mice\ncarried more protozoa in their guts than expected — specifically, a common\nsingle-celled parasite called _Tritrichomonas muris_.\n\nHowitt realized that _T. muris_ wasn’t an accidental infection but rather a\nnormal part of the microbiome in mice — something that neither he nor Garrett\nhad thought much about. “We weren’t looking for protozoa,” Howitt said. “We\nwere focused on bacteria.”\n\nTo confirm the relationship between the presence of the protozoa and the\nelevated numbers of tuft cells, Howitt ordered another set of similarly\npathogen-free mice from a different breeding facility and fed them some of the\nprotozoan-rich intestinal contents of the Harvard mice. The number of tuft\ncells in the new mice soared as the parasites colonized their intestines, too.\n\nThe numbers of tuft cells also climbed when Howitt infected mice with\nparasitic worms. But the increase didn’t happen in mice with defects in the\nbiochemical pathways underpinning their taste receptors, including those on\nthe tuft cells.\n\nHowitt’s findings were significant because they pointed to a possible role for\ntuft cells in the body’s defenses — one that would fill a conspicuous hole in\nimmunologists’ understanding. Scientists understood quite a bit about how the\nimmune system detects bacteria and viruses in tissues. But they knew far less\nabout how the body recognizes invasive worms, parasitic protozoa and\nallergens, all of which trigger so-called type 2 immune responses. Howitt and\nGarett’s work suggested that tuft cells might act as sentinels, using their\nabundant chemosensory receptors to sniff out the presence of these intruders.\nIf something seems wrong, the tuft cells could send signals to the immune\nsystem and other tissues to help coordinate a response.\n\nAt the same time that Howitt was working, Locksley and his postdoc Jakob von\nMoltke (who now runs his own lab at the University of Washington) were homing\nin on that finding from another direction by studying some of the chemical\nsignals (cytokines) involved in allergies. Locksley had discovered a group of\ncells called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that secrete these\ncytokines. ILC2s, he found, release cytokines after receiving a signal from a\nchemical called IL-25. Locksley and von Moltke used a fluorescent tag to mark\nintestinal cells that produced IL-25. The only cells that gave off a red glow\nin their experiments were tuft cells. Locksley had barely even heard of them.\n\n“Even textbooks of [gastrointestinal] medicine had no idea what these cells\ndid,” he said.\n\nThe Howitt-Garrett and Locksley-von Moltke papers were prominently featured in\n_Science_ and _Nature_, respectively. Together with a third paper in _Nature_\nby Philippe Jay of the Institute for Functional Genomics at the National\nCenter for Scientific Research in France and his colleagues, these studies\nprovided the first explanation for what tuft cells do: They recognize\nparasites by means of a small molecule called succinate, an end product of\nparasite metabolism. Once succinate binds to a tuft cell, it triggers the\nrelease of IL-25, which alerts the immune system to the problem. As part of\nthe defensive cascade, the IL-25 also helps to initiate the production of\nmucus by nearby goblet cells and triggers muscle contractions to remove the\nparasites from the gut.\n\nFor the first time, biologists had found at least one explanation for what\ntuft cells do. Before this, “people just kind of ignored them or didn’t even\nrealize that they were there,” said Megan Baldridge, a molecular\nmicrobiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAs groundbreaking as this trio of studies was, the work focused on intestinal\ncells. No one knew at first whether the tuft cells appearing elsewhere\nthroughout the body play the same anti-parasitic role. Answers soon began to\nroll in, and it became clear that tuft cells respond to more than succinate\nand do more than help repel the body’s invaders. In the thymus (a small\nglobular outpost of the immune system nestled behind the breastbone), tuft\ncells help teach the immune system’s maturing T cells the difference between\nself proteins and non-self proteins. Kathleen DelGiorno, now a staff scientist\nat the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, helped to show that tuft cells\ncan help protect against pancreatic cancer by detecting cellular injury. And\nin Cohen’s studies of chronic nasal and sinus infection, he discovered that\nrecognition of bacterial pathogens such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ by\nreceptors for bitterness on tuft cells causes neighboring cells to pump out\nmicrobe-killing chemicals.\n\nAs a lung biologist and a colleague of Herbert’s at the University of\nPennsylvania, Andrew Vaughan followed these tuft-cell discoveries with\ninterest. In many cases, tuft cells appeared to be intimately involved with\nthe part of the immune response known as inflammation. Vaughan was studying\nhow tissue deep in the lungs repairs itself after inflammation caused by the\nflu virus. After reading about some of the new findings, Vaughan began to\nwonder whether tuft cells might be involved in the lungs’ recovery from\ninfluenza. He and Herbert infected mice with the influenza virus and searched\nthe lungs of those with severe symptoms for signs of tuft cells.\n\nIn a micrograph of lung tissue sampled 25 days after an influenza infection,\nnewly emerging tuft cells are stained yellow/green (at left; a closeup appears\nat right). Tuft cells don’t normally appear in these airways, but they seem to\nemerge as part of the body’s response against the infection.\n\nCourtesy of Andrew Vaughan\n\n“Sure enough, they were all over the place,” Vaughan said. But the tuft cells\nonly appeared after influenza infection, which made Vaughan believe that he\nand Herbert were “basically seeing a cell type where [it’s] not supposed to\nbe.” Although he’s unsure exactly why this proliferation of tuft cells happens\nafter the flu, Vaughan speculates that it might be an aspect of the body’s\nattempt to repair damage from the virus as part of the broader type 2 immune\nresponse.\n\nThe researchers don’t yet know what the tuft cells are doing in the lungs or\nwhat they are sensing, but Herbert believes that their ability to continually\n“taste” the environment for different compounds provides a key opportunity for\nthe body to respond to even minute threats.\n\nThe tuft cell, Herbert said, is constantly sensing the metabolic products\npresent in microenvironments within the body. “Once some of those metabolic\nproducts go out of whack … bam! Tuft cells can recognize it and make a\nresponse if something is wrong.”\n\nNewly discovered connections between tuft cells and the immune and nervous\nsystems provide further evidence that chemosensory receptors are multipurpose\ntools like Swiss Army knives, with evolved functions beyond taste and smell.\nIt isn’t clear which function evolved first, though, or whether they all\nevolved in tandem, Howitt says. Just because scientists became aware of\n“taste” receptors on the tongue first, “that doesn’t mean that’s the order in\nwhich it evolved.”\n\nIn fact, a preliminary study in rats hints that the receptors’ immune\nfunctions may have evolved first. Two groups of immune cells known as\nmonocytes and macrophages use formyl peptide receptors on their membranes to\ndetect chemical cues from pathogens, and a group of Swiss scientists showed\nthat rats use these same receptors to detect pheromone odors. Those facts\nsuggest that at some point in history, the ancestors of rats made scent\nreceptors out of the immunological molecules. The evolutionary history of\nother groups of olfactory and taste receptors has yet to be deciphered.\n\nWhatever their history, scientists now say that a major role of these\nreceptors is to monitor the molecules in our body, tasting and smelling them\nfor any sign that they might be from a pathogen. Then, with help from tuft\ncells and other parts of the immune system, the body can fight off the\ninvaders before they’ve gotten a foothold. But Vaughan cautioned that the\nsudden emergence of tuft cells in tissues like the lungs, where they are not\nalways present, might also cause its own pathologies.\n\n“You may not always want to have the ability to [defensively] overreact,” he\nsaid. That could be part of what goes wrong in conditions like allergies and\nasthma: There could be dangers “if you have too many of these cells and\nthey’re too poised to respond to the external environment.”\n\n_**Correction added Nov. 18, 2019:** The caption below the photograph of\nHerbert originally made an unconfirmed statement that he was the first to\nobserve the tuft cells in the infected lungs of the mice._\n\n_This article was reprinted on_ _Wired.com_ _._\n\n### Carrie Arnold\n\n _Contributing Writer_\n\n* * *\n\n _November 15, 2019_\n\n* * *\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nbiologycell biologyimmunology\n\n### Share this article\n\n###### Copied!\n\n* * *\n\n### Newsletter\n\n _Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox_\n\nSubscribe now\n\nMost recent newsletter\n\n## The Quanta Newsletter\n\n _Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox_\n\nSubscribe\n\n#### Most recent newsletter\n\n# Comment on this article\n\n _Quanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.

(credit: NASA/Jude\nGuidry)  \n  \n---  \n  \n# Seeking a bigger role for a big rocket\n\n### by Jeff Foust  \nMonday, November 18, 2019\n\n  \n\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of\nits long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud\nAssembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four\nRS-25 engines into the rocket’s core stage. With those engines in place, the\ncore stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center\nfor testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where\nthose four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS\nlaunch.\n\n“If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and\nground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier\ndate,” Cooke said.  \n---  \n  \nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in\nthe 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While\nthe plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will\nnonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite\ncost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least\nlate 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it\nwould be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly\nnot limited to) SpaceX.\n\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some\nmembers of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is,\nNASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current\nexploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with\nthe more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer\nlaunches.\n\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s\nown party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last\n40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon\nand Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian\nBabin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space\nsubcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans.\n\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS)\nprocurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers\nthat NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be\nlaunched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final\nversion did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided\nthey worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo\nversion of the SLS.)\n\n“While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses\nmidstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued.\n\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view,\nminimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s\ncurrent architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched\ncommercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The\nlunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did\npropose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the\nascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander\nfrom the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\n\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical\noperations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said\nDoug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an\nindustry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House\nsubcommittee. (Cooke’s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS\ncore stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views\nlong before working with Boeing.)\n\n“If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” Stafford said\nof returning to the Moon.  \n---  \n  \n“SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry\nOrion,” he continued. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS\nwith the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance\nof making an earlier date.” He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two\nSLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the\ntwo rendezvousing in lunar orbit—no Gateway required.\n\nAt last week’s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom\nStafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment.\nRep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them\nabout the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission\nsafety.\n\n“The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,” Stafford, a\nmember of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke’s earlier\ntestimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success\nwith the current multiple-launch approach. “I cannot disagree with it.”\n\n“But with eight launches, I’ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of\nsuccess goes down to about 50 percent,” he concluded.\n\n“Oh my,” Lucas responded with a sigh.\n\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-\nlift launch vehicle. “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to\nmake it,” he said. “You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big,\nwide-diameter booster. If you don’t have it, you’re not going to make it.”\n\nYoung, in his testimony, didn’t specifically address the use of SLS versus\ncommercial rockets, but did criticize what he called “experiments” in\nprocurement. “Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the\nMars-Moon program,” he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment,\nhe brought up the HLS program.\n\n“A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to\nthe surface of the Moon,” he said. “I personally think that these should be\ngovernment-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.”\n\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human\nspaceflight. “The plate is really full today,” he said. “I personally think\nthat the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number\ntwo is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done\nthat will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.”\n\nOne thing Young would push off NASA’s plate is the Gateway. “I do not really\nsee a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,” he said, although\nit could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. “There’s not a\ncompelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.”\n\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. “Adding an\nadditional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”  \n---  \n  \nLast week’s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of\nCongress questioned NASA’s use—or unwillingness to use—the SLS. At a hearing\nlast month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep.\nRobert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater\nuse of SLS.\n\n“I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for\nSLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,” he said,\nincluding the first Block 1B. “What do you think?”\n\n“It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,” responded\nNASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn’t funding to\nsupport that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\n“We haven’t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we’re guaranteed\nthe second core we’d need for a Moon landing in 2024,” added Ken Bowersox, the\nacting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA\nand the other witness at the hearing.\n\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced\nby 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first\ncrewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024\nthat would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface\nof the Moon. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident\nthat could happen.”\n\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. “What commercial launch\nvehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to\nlaunch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the\nMoon by 2024?”\n\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But\nfor the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy\nand Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from\nBlue Origin, and Northrop Grumman’s OmegA.\n\n“There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,” Bridenstine added. “We’re\nnot shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some\ninvestment from Boeing to achieve.”\n\n“What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not\navailable by 2024,” Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy\nis, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles—or SLS.\n\n“But if commercial’s not available, what’s the contingency plan?” Aderholt\nasked again.\n\n“I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing\nin 2024 very, very difficult,” Bridenstine said. “If we don’t have the\nadditional rockets, then we’re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu\nwe’re confident we’ll have those rockets.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it\nwould provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal\narchitecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” Babin said of\npotential spending shortfalls for Artemis.  \n---  \n  \nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets,\nciting Cooke’s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged\nthat more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall\narchitecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more\nlaunches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\n“We’re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing\nSystem how their systems ought to be developed,” Bridenstine said. “We’re\nwaiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we’ll assess\ntheir approaches.”\n\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that\nits approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day\nthe proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would\ninvolve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\n“Using the lift capability of NASA’s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have\ndeveloped a ‘Fewest Steps to the Moon’ approach that minimizes mission\ncomplexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar\nsurface,” Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing\nDefense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\n\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the “national team” led\nby Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.\nThe companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicles\nwould be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely\nbelieved to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the\ncompany has declined to publicly confirm that.)\n\nNASA’s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House\nnor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion\nbudget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis\non track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. José Serrano (D-NY),\nchairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without\nmore information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has\nyet to disclose.\n\n“It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal\nyear when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said. He suggested\npushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to\nthis March, “in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission\nfor the benefit of the American people and the world.”\n\nBabin referred to those comments at last week’s hearing, concluding that the\nodds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were ”dwindling.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it\nwould provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal\narchitecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” he said.\n“This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments\nalready made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.”\n\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA’s architecture for\nreturning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also\ninclude revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\n\n* * *\n\nJeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space\nReview, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

We’re on it.’: Spokane ad agencies divided on South Dakota’s viral\ncampaign\n\nUPDATED: Tue., Nov. 19, 2019\n\nMaterials from South Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign.\n(onmeth.com)\n\n__Twitter\n\n__Facebook\n\n__Email\n\n__Reddit\n\n__SMS\n\nBy Megan Rowe __meganr@spokesman.com(509) 459-5382\n\nSouth Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” awareness campaign has been facing\nbacklash and mockery since introduced on Monday, but Michelle Hege’s response\nwas concern.\n\nHege is the CEO of DH, the Spokane advertising, public relations and branding\nfirm behind the Washington Healthcare Authority’s Opioid Prevention campaign\n“Starts with one.”\n\n“I guess my first reaction was, ‘Oh no, they’re going to get a lot of\nattention and, maybe, not all of it helpful attention,’ ” Hege said. “At the\nend of the day, the proof’s in the pudding. I’m sure they’ve got a good\nevaluation plan in place to look at results over time, but I did feel\nconcerned that it may just create noise that doesn’t actually drive the\nbehaviors that they’re looking to drive.”\n\nWhen developing the “Starts with one” campaign – which will be in its third\nyear in January – DH did extensive research into the targeted audiences,\nworking with them directly to understand their knowledge, beliefs and values\nregarding opioid misuse. Selling a product is difficult, but altering behavior\nis much more difficult, Hege said.\n\n“It’s difficult to change people’s behaviors, but this is also some of the\nmost important advertising and communications work that’s out there,” Hege\nsaid. “This is our favorite kind of work to do because it’s a way to make a\npositive impact in the world.”\n\nWhile the “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham,\nWashington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she\ndid not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful\nfor its audience.\n\n“When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can\neither be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that’s not\nintended to see it,” Graham said.\n\nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that\nencouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive\nscreenings.\n\n“You might need to have a message that’s very unique to the population that\nmight be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt\nlike it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might\nhave a little edgier message,” Graham said. “If somebody from the general\npublic saw it, they might think, ‘Wow this is a little over the edge’ or they\nmight think, ‘Why are they putting it here?’ It’s because it’s meant for a\nspecific population.”\n\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering\nthe example of a recent domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\n“We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on\ngaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that’s where a lot\nof young men were spending more time,” Graham said. “It can seem like there’s\na thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might\nbe looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very\naudience-centric.”\n\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising\nand design agency, said he thought South Dakota’s campaign – run by a\nMinneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 – was meant to raise\neyebrows.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the\ndining table of the company’s kitchen, where he posts new marketing findings\nand other things for members of his firm to ponder.\n\n“OK, great, let’s be provocative, let’s get people to notice it and talk about\nit, but I don’t think people are talking about it in the way that you want\nthem talking about it, right?” Sanborn said. “What’s America talking about?\nSouth Dakota’s got a meth problem, so that’s not the best thing for the South\nDakota brand.”\n\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That\nmessage is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and “we want to\ntry to help,” Sanborn said.\n\n“The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they’ll put the heart of their\nmessage somewhere deep in their third paragraph,” Sanborn said. “If that’s the\ncore and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that\neverybody in America reads.”\n\n**Wordcount:** 717\n\n**Published:** Nov. 19, 2019, 6:18 p.m. **Updated:** Nov. 19, 2019, 7:10 p.m.\n\n**Tags:** ads, advertisement, awareness, meth, methamphetamine, nation, news,\nsouth dakota\n\n__\n\n## Subscribe to the Morning Review newsletter\n\nGet the day’s top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning by\nsubscribing to our newsletter.\n\nYou have been successfully subscribed!\n\nThere was a problem subscribing you to the newsletter.

The five companies can\nnow vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to\npave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\n\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\"\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group\nof companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface\ndrives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We\nanticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology\npayloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance\nour goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\n\n **Related:** **SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Mars Rocket in Pictures**\n\nThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018,\nbringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\n\nThe newly selected five are:\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nNASA has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems to build the private moon landers needed to help\nreturn astronauts to the moon in 2024.\n\n(Image credit: Future/SpaceX/Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada)\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nAn artist's concept of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander.\n\n(Image credit: Blue Origin)\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nThis Sierra Nevada Corp. illustration shows a concept of the company's\ncommercial lunar lander for NASA.\n\n(Image credit: Sierra Nevada Corp.)\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nAn artist's concept of a Ceres Robotics moon lander and lunar rover on the\nmoon's surface.\n\n(Image credit: Ceres Robotics)\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nThis illustration shows a concept moon lander by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems,\nInc.\n\n(Image credit: Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.)\n\n  * Blue Origin, Kent, Washington\n  * Ceres Robotics, Palo Alto, California\n  * Sierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, Colorado\n  * SpaceX, Hawthorne, California\n  * Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, California\n\nThey include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly\nmassive — SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle — to land multiple rovers on the\nmoon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak\nNano-Satellite Systems.\n\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of\nprivate industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's\nassociate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the\nstatement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we’ll expand our\nability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and\nsupport human exploration objectives.\"\n\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which\nthe company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\n\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that\ncould potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\n\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to\ndeliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration\nRover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power\nstations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\n\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through\nNovember 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the\nprogram can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\"\nClarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to\nreally broaden the pool — to bring on additional capabilities with new,\ninnovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\n\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding\nlander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond.\nOrbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on\nfuture opportunities.\n\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new\ntechnology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do\nmuch more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our\ncommercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate\nadministrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the\nstatement.\n\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by\n2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around\nthe moon by 2028.\n\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on\nMars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have\nstressed.\n\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers.\nThis past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build\nprototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the\nArtemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early\nnext year.\n\n  * Moon Rush: Private Lunar Lander Plans\n  * Here's Where Commercial Landers Will Land on the Moon for NASA\n  * NASA: The International Space Station Is Open for Business in Orbit\n\n _Editor's note: This story was updated at 5:45 p.m. ET to include details\nfrom the NASA telecon._\n\n _Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him_ _@tariqjmalik_ _._\n_Follow us on Twitter_ _ _@Spacedotcom__ _and on_ _ _Facebook__ _._\n\n _Need more space?_ _Subscribe to our sister title \"All About Space\" Magazine_\n_for the latest amazing news from the final frontier!_\n\n(Image credit: All About Space)\n\n_Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

Why\nit’s crucial, actually!\n\nIf we haven’t met yet, my name is Pamela Wilson — and I have been working\nonline since 2010.\n\nI’m a three-time author, a keynote speaker, and an online educator, coach, and\nmastermind group leader.\n\n> I help people build online businesses they _**love**._\n\nIn this article, and in the coming weeks, I’m sharing my approach to online\nbusiness growth.\n\nIt was born from helping thousands of people create the online presence\nthey’ve dreamt of — and seeing way too many of them lose focus and struggle to\nget any results at all.\n\nOnce you understand my simple approach, you’ll feel much better about where\nyou are in the online business growth process — and that’s a promise.\n\n### How can I promise you’re about to feel better?\n\nBecause once you understand my approach …\n\n  * You’ll recognize you don’t have to master everything about online business all at once\n  * Your to-do list will shrink to 25% of its current size\n  * You’ll be able to safely ignore 75% of the online information you’re seeing right now\n\nGet ready to start _enjoying_ the process of building your online business —\nmaybe for the first time ever!\n\nIf you are …\n\n  * Trying to build an online business because you have deep expertise on a specific topic — but you’re “on hold” because you’re feeling overwhelmed\n  * Wanting to leave a legacy of information and guidance around a topic you’re passionate about — but you don’t know where to start\n  * Passionate about the business idea you’ve imagined — but unsure about how to make it happen\n\n… stick around. What you’re about to read is critical information that could\nchange the course of your life.\n\nReally.\n\n###\n\n### How to maintain a business focus the easy way\n\nThe goal of this series of articles is to help you steadily build the online\nbusiness you have in mind right now — without ever feeling lost and\noverwhelmed.\n\n> You’re about to feel the relief that comes from having a clear business\n> focus.\n\nYou’ll understand what matters now — and what you can ignore.\n\nThis is the key to making steady progress as you build your online presence!\n\n###\n\n### A genius approach to online business building?\n\nNot to get too Albert Einstein on you, but …\n\nEvery online business exists in the 'space-time continuum.'Click To Tweet __\n\nThink about it:\n\n  * You build your website in its own little corner of the internet\n  * Search engines find it at the moment in time that it goes live\n  * People begin to discover and use it\n  * Your relationship with the people you attract grows person-by-person and day-by-day\n\nThe faster you can create an online business that exists in both space and\ntime, the faster these benefits will accrue:\n\n  * Search engines will drive people to your information\n  * You’ll go from imagining the people you want to serve to serving real people\n  * Your email list will begin to grow\n  * Your products and services will all benefit from the interaction\n  * Your revenues and impact will grow year-by-year\n\nAre you ready to make this happen?\n\n### How to avoid falling for every online pitch you see\n\nBefore we start, I’ve got to warn you about something that’s critically\nimportant. Not paying attention to this will virtually guarantee that you will\nstay stuck where you are.\n\nAnd you’ll have _a lot less money in your bank account._\n\nHere’s the thing …\n\nWhen you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of\ncharacters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.\n\nI'm here to tell you that the Laws of Physics apply to online business just\nlike offline business.Click To Tweet __\n\nIt takes time to build a successful business — offline **and** online.\n\n(I know, radical statement, right?)\n\nI want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get\ntime on your side.\n\nTrying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would\nhave you believe. It has its challenges.\n\nThere’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a _lot_ of\nmarketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with.\n\nAnd there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs\nto interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.\n\n> Today, I’m going to demystify the process of building your online business.\n\nYou’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it\nturns out your don’t need to **Buy All The Things** and **Learn All The\nThings** in order to make it online.\n\nI developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and\nerror — mine, and the people I taught.\n\n **It’s called Plan & Grow BIG.**\n\n###\n\n### Focus on what really matters in the near future of your business\n\n **Plan & Grow BIG** helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might\nbe stopping you from making real progress in your online business.\n\nMaybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying\nfor years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t\nliving up to what you expected.\n\n> Either way, you’re in the right place because today’s information will help\n> you catapult forward.\n\nI developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting\nsidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to\nmaster.\n\nFor example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads —\nbefore they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were\ngoing to offer.\n\nAnd I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was\nproven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an\nunproven product.)\n\nI saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁\n\nSmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But\nthey were completely baffled by this “online business thing.”\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the\nfrustrations myself.\n\n###\n\n### True confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way\n\nBefore I outline the **Plan & Grow BIG** approach and the specifics for each\nstage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.\n\nI’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.\n\nBack in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business,\nZurek Design.\n\nI had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled\nprojects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also\njuggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their\n“launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at\nuniversities and think about their careers.\n\nI didn’t have a lot of time to spare.\n\nPlus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become\nmuch more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the\npast. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And\nI’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars,\nand in online video.\n\n _Yikes._\n\nAnd although my _offline_ business was making a solid income, my _online_\nbusiness idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t\nmaking a single cent.\n\n> Who in their right mind invests in a business idea _before_ they know if it\n> will make money?\n\nI do, apparently!\n\nIt turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.\n\nBecause I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course\ncalled Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount\nof money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.\n\nBut I’m glad I did.\n\nI truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that\ninvestment, I was telling myself, _“This dream matters. This dream is going to\nbecome a reality. I’m taking this seriously.”_\n\nOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new,\nthings started happening for me.\n\nWithin a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an\narticle accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-\npopular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.\n\nThen another article went live. And another.\n\nNot just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the\nday.\n\nAnd through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then\ncoaching.\n\n###\n\n### Out with the old, in with the new (and better)\n\nWithin a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline\nbusiness made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to\nfocus exclusively on my online efforts.\n\nNow, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence.\n\nThat company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach\ntheir audience for a couple of years.\n\nHere’s what’s different in my life now:\n\n  * My business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)\n  * I am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me\n  * My books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single month\n  * People find my website and join my community every day, all year long\n  * I’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpack\n  * I can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule\n\nHere’s the other important thing …\n\nI also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer\nto no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs\nwhenever I’d like.\n\nBut this story isn’t about me.\n\nWhat I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what\ntruly works online.\n\nIt’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A\nbusiness where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings.\n\nAnd that’s what I want for you.\n\n### Ready to make online business building easier?\n\nYou wouldn’t have read this far if you didn’t also want to build this kind of\nonline business!\n\nThat’s why I want to make it easier for you.\n\n **What is your business focus right now?**\n\nIf you can’t answer that question immediately, read on.\n\n### How to use Plan & Grow BIG to get the business focus mindset you need\n\nThe purpose of the **Plan & Grow BIG** approach is to help you develop\nbusiness focus — and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from\nmaking progress.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI believe the #1 enemy of online progress is the flood of information about\nonline business tactics that bombards us every day.Click To Tweet __\n\nI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!\n\nAnd how developing **business focus** will allow you to build the business\nyou’re dreaming about much faster — and with less frustration.\n\nTo get started, I created a simple quiz and resource doc that will help you\nget more value from this article.\n\n> Grab my 12-question quiz that will help you pinpoint the stage you’re in\n> right now — and get guidance about how to maximize your results.\n\nGET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!\n\nClick the link above so you can:\n\n  *     * Discover what **business-building stage** you’re in now\n    * Assess what you’re starting with — make a **list of your current assets**\n    * Pinpoint what your **current business focus** should be\n    * Get to know **what happens in the other business stages** — so you can _focus_\n\nDownload it here so you can apply this to your business:\n\nGET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!\n\nAs we go through each stage of the **Plan & Grow BIG** approach, I want you to\nidentify areas of opportunity for your current situation.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n### The four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIG\n\n####\n\n#### The Plan Stage: Think and dream productively\n\nIt’s the early days of your business.\n\nThink BIG. And work only on what’s needed in this stage.\n\nIn the PLAN stage, make these your business focus:\n\n  *  **Pinpoint your ideal customer:** Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step — don’t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers.\n  *  **Get your branding in place:** The earlier the better when it comes to  \nbuilding your brand. You’ll want to decide your business name and  \ntagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts.\n\n  *  **Map out your first offer:** Decide how what solutions you’ll deliver and how you’ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?\n\nThat’s it. Once you’ve completed the items above, it’s time to start building\nyour business, my friend. Ready?\n\n####\n\n#### The Build Stage: Create a tangible online asset\n\nTime to make ideas _real._ As you build these tangible business assets,\nremember: you don’t have to do it all at once.\n\nFocus on these business goals during the BUILD stage:\n\n  *  **Build your initial website:** You’ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of “commerce” page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.\n  *  **Build your first offer:** Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.\n  *  **Build an initial funnel:** Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.\n\nAnd now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to\nlook around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have\nto catch up to them.\n\nNonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and\nbe proud you’re ready to move on …\n\n####\n\n#### The Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works\n\nOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can\nfeel deeply uncomfortable.\n\nBut growth usually _does_ feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it?\n\nThe IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s\nwhat you’ll focus on while you’re there:\n\n  *  **Make your offers live:** Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.\n  *  **Focus on building your email list.** Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a _referral network._\n  *  **Discover what works for launching your products and services.** Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.\n\nRemember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to\ndevelop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business.\nPatience, my friend!\n\nBut once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for …\n\n####\n\n#### The Grow Stage: Leverage your success\n\nIn the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably\nin your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success.\n\n  *  **Improve your conversion rates:** Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.\n  *  **Add more revenue streams:** As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.\n\nThe GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are\nreliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business.\n\n### Ready? Set? Business focus!\n\nNow that you know your business stage (you DID download the quiz, right?), you\ncan tap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. **Ignore\nall the techniques you’ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the\nstage you’re in.**\n\nGet the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist\nof all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.\n\nWhen you do this, you can count on steady business growth — with less\nfrustration and more confidence because you’re focused on the right thing at\nthe right time.\n\n###\n\n### The next BIG challenge is …\n\nNow that you’re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate\nfrustration and make faster progress, here’s the next big online business\nchallenge …\n\n **Becoming a “visible” and public leader in your space.**\n\nThis was a HUGE stumbling block for me.\n\nIn the next article, I’m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you\nbecome more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader. Once you\nembrace the increased visibility that comes with building an online business,\nyou’ll see all sorts of interesting doors open up.\n\n### Your go-forward plan for business focus\n\nThe BIG question is, how do you successfully shape an online business dream\ninto a viable online business that gives you the income, freedom, and\nrecognition you deserve?\n\nIt comes down to business focus. Which is easy once you know _what_ to focus\non, and what to ignore.\n\nOnce you’ve built that business, you have to stand out in front of it and\nrepresent it in your marketing, on social media, and at in-person events.\n\nIf you don’t master this, you’ll severely limit your reach and your impact. So\nhow do you get comfortable with this increased visibility?\n\nHow can you step up and embrace the “internet limelight?” Because once you do,\nonline doors will open for you!\n\nRead about that topic in the next article in this series, How to Adopt an\nOnline Leader Success Mindset.\n\nPamela Wilsonbigbrandsystem\n\n258 Shares\n\n __Buffer\n\n __Share\n\n __Pin\n\n __Tweet\n\n __Share\n\n __Email\n\n  * __ Creating Offers, Online Business\n  * __ business journey\n\n#### Pamela Wilson\n\nPamela Wilson is an online educator, author, keynote speaker, and the founder\nof BIG Brand System.

Gaye\n\nAugust 8, 2018 at 3:17 pm\n\nYOU.ARE.AWESOME!\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 8, 2018 at 7:07 pm\n\nThanks so much for stopping by to read this long article, Gaye, and for\nleaving a comment, too! You’re pretty awesome yourself — I’m glad our paths\nhave crossed. 🙂\n\n  2. Jan Smith\n\nAugust 8, 2018 at 7:21 pm\n\nHi, Pamela, I am a guy in his mid-70’s who has had 2 financial disasters. I\nspent all savings (including all retirement $) just to survive. That said, I’m\nhaving the time of my life right now by helping others to conquer fear, worry,\ndoubt panic, etc. by applying wisdom from the Bible that God has patiently\npoured into me. The comments I receive from readers is so astonishing to me! I\nnever started out to do anything like that.  \nBlog articles are free for anyone to read, but I do have two online courses\nthat bundle together articles from the blog with some new content. The income\npays for secure web hosting, and list-building technology.  \nWhat I’m wondering is: given that my focus is more on being helpful than on\ngetting the money, I don’t see that as being consistent with the focus of\nevery purveyor of online “how to sell, sell, sell” focus.  \nSo, how would your plan help someone like me, given that I have no extra money\nand will not go into debt to buy whatever you are selling?\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 8, 2018 at 7:34 pm\n\nI’m really glad to hear you’ve found a way to serve that feels really good to\nyou, Jan.\n\nI offer free information every single month here on the blog. I host free in-\ndepth workshops every month, too.\n\nIf you feel like buying something, you can get my 99 cent Kindle book! And if\nyou really want to splurge, you can get _Master Content Marketing_ for well\nunder $20.\n\nThere’s absolutely no need take on debt to learn around here — I hope you find\nit helpful.\n\n  3. Anita DeSousa\n\nAugust 10, 2018 at 9:40 am\n\nEnjoyed your article, focus is extremely important to be successful with\nanything!\n\nI have many ideas floating around just not sure how to make a go of it with an\nonline business or if that is even the right thing for me. 🤔\n\nWill continue to read articles and learn, so it will not be so overwhelming\nwhen I can “focus” and do it right.\n\nUntil then just juggling 🤹‍♀️\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 10, 2018 at 9:51 am\n\nAnita, it’s so good to see you here! That “ideas floating around” challenge is\nsomething every entrepreneur I know has to deal with. I hope you find some\nclarity on these pages. 🙂\n\n  4. Yvonne DiVita\n\nAugust 11, 2018 at 9:51 am\n\nI relate to the ” you can spend a lot of money on a lot of things and get\nnowhere” idea. So many people are out there pitching us. I get so many\ninvitations to build a better business, using this advice or that. And, it’s\nalways the same.\n\nExcept here. You are unique. Your approach is so focused, it’s almost funny…\nbecause, why can’t we figure all that out? I know the answer… the answer is –\nbecause we are bombarded with content that purports to have the answer and we\nspend too much time trying to do things the way someone else wants us to. The\nanswer is not in someone else’s head.\n\nThe answer is in us…however, the journey we travel along, needs guidance and\nsherpas. Like you.\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 11, 2018 at 11:35 am\n\n“The answer is not in someone else’s head.”\n\nAmen, sister: preach!!!\n\n  5. Tom Collins\n\nAugust 11, 2018 at 10:41 am\n\nHi Pamela, so excited to see this new iteration of your wisdom! Your timing is\ngreat for me.\n\nAs you’ll recall, I was deep into your Build stage, about ready to start\nImplementing, months ago — when we made the sudden (unexpected, to me)\ndecision to move back across the country from CO to upstate NY. Which threw me\nback into your “on hold” status, business-wise. After “implementing” the\ndecision to move, I’ve been literally building things (deck, fence, french\ndoors and windows, kitchen remodel, etc.) to get us settled into the new digs!\n\nBut by this fall I’ll be diving back into my business work and can’t wait to\napply your always-helpful tips!\n\nTHANKS!\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 11, 2018 at 11:34 am\n\nSo good to see you here, Tom. Life gets in the way sometimes, doesn’t it? Glad\nyou’re going to be able to re-focus now that you’re settling in to your new\nplace. 🙂\n\nComments are closed.\n\n### Learn More\n\nOnline Business Collection​\n\nBranding & Design Collection​\n\n###  Start Making More Sales: Remember This 5-Step Recipe for High-Converting\nSales Pages\n\n###  Five Marketing Tips from the Bakery Down the Street\n\n###  Why I Hate the Verdana Font\n\n__Prev Is Your Mindset Keeping You From Reaching Your Dream?\n\nHow to Adopt an Online Leader Success Mindset __Next\n\nGeneric selectors\n\nExact matches only\n\nExact matches only\n\nSearch in title\n\nSearch in title\n\nSearch in content\n\nSearch in content\n\nSearch in excerpt\n\nSearch in posts\n\nSearch in posts\n\nSearch in pages\n\nSearch in pages\n\nMore results…\n\nBlog homepage\n\n© Zurek Design LLC — Read our fascinating terms of service.\n\nClick to watch free on-demand training about online business and visual\nmarketing.\n\n  * Free Courses\n    * Visual Marketing Workshop\n    * Online Business Workshop\n    * Free Roadmap\n  * Books\n    * All BIG Brand Books\n    * Master Content Marketing\n    * Master Content Strategy\n    * Zero to Book Podcast\n  * Free Articles\n    * Online Business\n    * Branding & Design\n    * All Articles\n  * About\n    * Coaching Programs\n    * Speaking\n    * Contact\n\n__ Menu\n\n  * Free Courses\n    * Visual Marketing Workshop\n    * Online Business Workshop\n    * Free Roadmap\n  * Books\n    * All BIG Brand Books\n    * Master Content Marketing\n    * Master Content Strategy\n    * Zero to Book Podcast\n  * Free Articles\n    * Online Business\n    * Branding & Design\n    * All Articles\n  * About\n    * Coaching Programs\n    * Speaking\n    * Contact\n\n© All rights reserved | Terms\n\nTwitter __ Facebook __ Pinterest __ Instagram __\n\n# Need a hand?\n\n# Watch a free workshop now.

A review of surveillance video allegedly\nshowed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night,\naccording to court documents.\n\n“As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of\nfederal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,”\nGeoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said\nin a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks\non inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records.\nNoel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is\ncharged with three.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the\ncharges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday\nafternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond\nwithin a week.\n\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many\nvictims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons.\nAttorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered\nmultiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations\nat the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\n## Indictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the\nSenate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage\nover the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the\nprison system.\n\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer,\nrepeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track\nof such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify\nagainst his other co-conspirators.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of\nminor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other\nlocations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of\nPrisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some\nanswers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this.\n\n\"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of\nJeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives\nbehind bars,” Sasse said.\n\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation\nand a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she\nacknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other\ninstances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and\nfalsified records to show that they had.\n\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This\nincident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad\nstaff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when\nsomething bad happens.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems\nwithin the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of\nthe system.\"\n\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier\nmay have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports\nanything other than suicide.\n\n**Internal memo:** Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks,\ninmate counts\n\n## Investigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself\nwith a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he\nhad been murdered.\n\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned\nto Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers\nassigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at\nleast eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10,\nprosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that\nthey had not made their required checks.\n\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do\nany rounds.\"\n\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court\nhearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos.\nThey and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our\nhope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said\nJason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a\nplea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of\nthree children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n\n“We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to\naddress the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,”\nFiggins said.\n\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that\nthey’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re\ngoing to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night\nEpstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran\nand how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll\nhave a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n\n## Prisons plagued by understaffing\n\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and\nfrequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised\nsecurity at the Manhattan facility.\n\n**Staffers 'don't care':** Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before\nJeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at\nthe facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union.\nPrison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to\nplug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift,\nthe one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to\nfederal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the\n20 staffers were working overtime.\n\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention\ncenter, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave.\nOne of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime\nshifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling\nlawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the\nsystem.\n\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure\nof old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the\ncountry, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying,\n\"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s\ntrust in us.”\n\n**Epstein's inner circle eyed:** Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could\nstill go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\nThis March 28, 2017, file photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender\nRegistry shows Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nNew York State Sex Offender Registry via AP\n\n## Epstein removed from suicide watch\n\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell,\nsemiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him\non suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has\ndrawn investigative interest.\n\nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from\nsuicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the\ninmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n“When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be\ncritical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra\nmonitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert\nfrom San Diego.\n\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature\nof his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior\nsuicide attempt.\n\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to\nsee authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there\nare no coincidences.”\n\n_Contributing: Kristine Phillips_\n\nPublished 7:07 PM EST Nov 19, 2019\n\nTerms of Service Privacy Notice\n\n© Copyright Gannett 2018\n\n"

Ascom’s Unite Connect for\nclinical systems recently received FDA clearance for sales and distribution in\nthe US. It is also available in Canada.\n\nThe joint clinical alarm management solution extends the reach of patient\nalarms generated by Dräger’s patient monitoring system to mobile caregivers.\nThe alert message provides critical data and related contextual information\nright to the caregiver’s mobile device. The mobile delivery of waveform images\nadds a contextual dimension by helping increase awareness of the patient’s\ncondition and helping nurses distinguish between artifacts, false alarms, and\nreal alarms. Patients benefit from quicker response times to events.\n\nAlready in use at European hospitals in France, Belgium and Norway, Ascom’s\nUnite Connect for clinical systems is a software application utilizing\ncustomizable alarm filters to help minimize non-actionable alerts which can\ncause workflow bottlenecks. Nurses can then focus more effectively on patient\ncare rather than responding to alerts that do not require action. These alert\nnotification messages are intended as a secondary notification system to\ninform caregivers of patient events captured by these clinical systems and do\nnot replace the primary alarm functions on the monitors.\n\nSteve Menet, Senior Vice President of Sales for Dräger, Inc., says: “Effective\nclinical alarm management continues to be a high focus for health systems and\nhospitals. As the use of mobile technologies expands in healthcare, so does\nthe opportunity to extend alarm management to mobile caregivers. Our new\nsolution with Ascom provides customers the opportunity to communicate\nactionable patient information from our Infinity patient monitoring systems to\nclinicians, while filtering out nuisance alarms that contribute to alarm\nfatigue.”\n\nRob Goldman, President Ascom North America, says: “By collaborating with\nDräger, Ascom can help hospitals supplement and enhance their alarm management\nsolutions. Leveraging Unite Connect for clinical systems’ customizable alarm\nfiltering helps mobile caregivers avoid unnecessary work interruptions,\nlimiting their exposure to low-priority, routine alerts and helping reduce\ncaregiver alarm fatigue.”  \n\n* * *\n\n  \nAscom is a global solutions provider focused on healthcare ICT and mobile\nworkflow solutions.

But another one, in the United States, has barely begun.\n\nThe Wikileaks founder always argued that his fear of being extradited from\nSweden to the US was why he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in\nLondon. That political refuge ended unceremoniously in April, when he was\ndragged out by British police.\n\nNow Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US, including conspiring to hack\ngovernment computers and violating espionage laws. If convicted, he could face\ndecades in jail.\n\nFrom behind bars in Belmarsh jail, Assange is trying to prepare for the case.\nThe decision by Swedish prosecutors today means there'll now be no competing\nextradition request to the one from the US.\n\n## What was the Swedish investigation about?\n\nAssange was accused of rape by a woman and sexual assault by another one\nfollowing a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied\nthe allegations, saying the sex was consensual.\n\nHe also faced investigations for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these\ncases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\n## What has the reaction been?\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Assange but Wikileaks welcomed the Swedish\nmove to drop the investigation.\n\nWikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said: \"Let us now focus on the\nthreat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent\nprosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First\nAmendment.\"\n\n## What charges does Assange face in the US?\n\nAustralian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer\nintrusion in the US.\n\nHe is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government\nsecrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.\n\n  * How likely is an Assange conviction in US?\n\nIn June, the then UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, formally approved an\nextradition request from the US.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Assange gestures with a thumbs up after\nhe was arrested by Met Police officers at the Ecuador Embassy in London\n\nAssange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh in September after serving\nthe custody period of his jail term.\n\nBut a judge ruled that Assange should remain in jail until his extradition\nhearing because of his \"history of absconding\".\n\nLast month, a judge rejected Assange's attempt to delay the full extradition\nhearing, which is scheduled to take place at Westminster Magistrate's Court in\nLondon in February.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Sweden\n  * Wikileaks\n  * United States\n  * Julian Assange\n\n##  Share this story About sharing\n\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Messenger\n  * Messenger\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * WhatsApp\n  * LinkedIn\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * Video Julian Assange dragged from Ecuadorean embassy \n\n11 April 2019\n\n  * Video 'Misrule of law': Pamela Anderson's jail visit to Julian Assange \n\n7 May 2019\n\n  * Julian Assange doesn't consent to US extradition, court hears \n\n2 May 2019\n\n  * Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention seeker? \n\n19 November 2019\n\n  * Julian Assange: Why is the Wikileaks co-founder a wanted man? \n\n12 April 2019\n\n## Top Stories\n\n**Wave of Israeli strikes hit Iran's forces in Syria**\n\nIsrael's military says the strikes inside Syria were in response to rockets\nfired by Iranian troops.\n\n20 November 2019\n\n**Former UK consulate worker says China tortured him**\n\n20 November 2019\n\n**Suspect in Malta journalist murder held on yacht**\n\n20 November 2019\n\n##  Features\n\n### How a vote in Ethiopia could test Nobel prize winner\n\nVideo\n\n### Meet the women on a mission to clear landmines\n\nVideo\n\n### Three tips to win an election debate\n\n### Why do billions of people still not have glasses?\n\n### How to buy an Instagram following\n\n### Amazon gets closer to getting Alexa everywhere\n\n### Zimbabwe - the land where cash barons thrive\n\nVideo\n\n### Sucking up CO2 from one of the world's worst emitters\n\n### BBC Future: The race to escape Arctic sea ice\n\n##  Elsewhere on the BBC\n\n###  Lyrics quiz\n\nHave you been getting these songs wrong?\n\nFull article Lyrics quiz\n\n###  Feeling hot\n\nWhat happens to your body in extreme heat?\n\nFull article Feeling hot\n\nWhy you can trust BBC News\n\n## BBC News Navigation\n\nWorld Sections\n\n  * Africa\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Europe selected\n  * Latin America\n  * Middle East\n  * US & Canada\n\n  * Home\n  * Video\n  * World selected\n\n    * World Home\n    * Africa\n    * Asia\n    * Australia\n    * Europe selected\n    * Latin America\n    * Middle East\n    * US & Canada\n\n  * UK\n\n    * UK Home\n    * England\n    * N.

Тогда\nтрудно было найти журнал, на страницах которого не было бы фотографий Полины.\nЗатем девушка подалась в мир кино. Она снималась у многих режиссеров\n(например, у Кустурицы в «Аризонской мечте»), а ее партнерами по фильмам\nстановились Джонни Депп и Микки Рурк.\n\nСейчас Полине исполнилось 53 года, и хоть выглядит она до сих пор на все сто,\nее охватила настоящая паника.\n\nРазве этой красотке дашь 53 года?\n\nФото\n\n    @paulinaporizkov\n\nВ интервью модель призналась, что жутко боится старости. «Когда вся ваша жизнь\nсостояла в том, чтобы выглядеть хорошо, стареть публично – это ужасно. Это не\nдля слабонервных, – пожаловалась Поризкова. — Я постоянно борюсь с собой,\nвнутренне говоря: «Да ладно, красота не так уж важна! Отпусти ее и\nсосредоточься больше на том, что еще можно сделать!»\n\nНо пока у модели это не получается. Она откровенно рассказала, что, хоть пока\nи не колола ботокс, постоянно прибегает к тем или иным процедурам красоты,\nчтобы сохранить молодость как можно дольше, и тратит на это почти все\nсвободное время.\n\n«Я лично ненавижу, когда вижу, что кто-то сделал и пластику, и уколы для\nсохранения красоты, но они утверждают, что причина, по которой они так хорошо\nвыглядят, – это йога и вода. Сразу понятно, что они врут».\n\nБывшая супермодель призналась, что боится: люди высмеивают то, как она\nвыглядит сейчас. «Я думаю, что кто-то сейчас скажет: эй, посмотри на эту\nкрасивую женщину, которая превратилась в эту отвратительную старуху».\n\nНо нам кажется, Поризкова слегка лукавит. Старухой ее назвать ни у кого язык\nне повернется. Полина до сих пор позирует для глянцевых журналов и выглядит\nлучше многих молодых моделей. Между прочим, некоторые фотосеты весьма\nпровокационны. Например, она приняла участие в проекте для модного издания.\nВместо одежды на телах моделей были лишь надписи, отражавшие самые важные для\nних ценности. Поризкова выбрала слово «Правда».\n\nДа и муж Полины до сих пор просто обожает ее. Поризкова и музыкант Рик Оказек\nпоженились еще на заре ее карьеры и уже почти 30 лет счастливы в браке. Да и\nкто бы не гордился такой красавицей-женой!\n\n#### Материалы по теме\n\n  * Как молоды мы были: звездные пары в начале отношений и сейчас\n  * Угадайте, кто.

In the end, we will\nwin and save our Country from certain destruction,” Trump tweeted soon after\nthe House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public\nimpeachment hearings on Tuesday.\n\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a\nUkraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer\nWilliams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July\n25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison,\nanother top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\n\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats’ central allegation in this\nimpeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press\nSecretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\n“Specifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no\nindication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating\nhis previous deposition testimony that ‘there was no linkage like that,\" she\nsaid.\n\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the\nDemocrats.\n\n“With the Democrats’ poll-tested ‘quid-pro-quo’ and ‘bribery’ narratives in\nshambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for\none more second,” Grisham said.\n\n“We have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate ‘impeachment’\nproceedings. However, buried among the witnesses’ personal opinions and\nconjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both\nwitnesses testified the July 25 transcript was ‘accurate’ and nothing\nPresident Trump has done or said amounts to ‘bribery’ or any other crime,” she\nadded.\n\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for\nPresident Trump.\n\n“Today's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats\nare simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to\noverturn the outcome of a free and fair election,” Grisham said.\n\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump’s request to\nUkrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\n\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with\nAmerican national security goals.\n\n“Frankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of\nshock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy\ncould play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant\nimplications for US national security,” Vindman said.\n\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\n“I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the\npresident's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different\nthan other calls I had listened to,” she said.\n\n“I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such\nas former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature\ngiven that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,”\nWilliams said.\n\n“I can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I\njust noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,” she said in\nresponse to a question.\n\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016\nelections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be\nconspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly\nthe former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be\npursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\n“We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight\nagainst corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense\ncapabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't\nthink pursuing these things serves a national interest,” Volker said.\n\nDH Newsletter  Privacy Policy Get top news in your inbox daily\n\nGET IT\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWhite House\n\nUkraine\n\nUSA\n\n0 Comments (+)\n\n###  Related stories\n\n####  Beijing warns US diplomat over Hong Kong rights bill...\n\n####  150 Indians deported from US land at Delhi airport...\n\n####  Diehards remain at HK campus as foreign pressure grows...\n\n####  US, China fossil fuel polluters far off climate targets...\n\n####  'Climate impacts to cost world $7.9 trillion by 2050'...\n\n####  Oil prices steady after 2-day drop amid growth concerns...\n\n### DH Picks\n\n  * ####  PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr... \n\n  * ####  Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year \n\n  * ####  KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams... \n\n  * ####  Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill \n\n  * ####  Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes... \n\n##  social feed\n\n#### What does your star sign say?\n\nExplore\n\nNational\n\n  * Politics\n  * North and Central\n  * South\n  * East and Northeast\n  * West\n\nKarnataka\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Politics\n  * Districts\n\nBengaluru\n\n  * Top Stories\n  * Bengaluru Crime\n  * Politics\n  * Infrastructure\n  * Life in the City\n\nSports\n\n  * Cricket\n  * ICC World Cup 2019\n  * Formula 1 with DH\n  * Football\n  * Tennis\n  * Sportscene\n  * Other Sports\n\nBusiness\n\n  * Business News\n  * Budget 2019\n  * Economy & Business\n  * Family Finance\n  * Technology\n  * DH Wheels\n\nMultimedia\n\n  * Videos\n  * Photos\n\nOpinion\n\n  * DH Views\n  * Editorials\n  * Panorama\n  * Comment\n  * In Perspective\n  * Right in the Middle\n\nEntertainment\n\n  * Entertainment News\n  * DH Talkies\n  * Arts, Books & Culture\n\nMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 Live\n\nKarnataka Bypolls 2019 Live\n\nIndia vs Bangladesh\n\nChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visuals\n\nAyodhya verdict\n\nPegasus snoops through WhatsApp\n\nDH Picks\n\n  * PSU banks report fraud of over Rs 95,000 cr in Apr-Sep \n  * Karnataka Bypolls: Turncoats get richer in a year\n  * KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams\n  * Bullet Rani discharged, activists struggle to pay bill\n  * Social audits key to finding issues in govt schemes\n\nLatest stories\n\n  * Pawar meets Modi, briefs on farm crisis in Maharashtra\n  * A Dhankhar-shaped question around the role of governors\n  * Don't mix politics and security to leaders: Cong in RS\n  * Vodafone Idea, Airtel rally for 4th consecutive season\n  * RIL market cap inches closer to Rs 10 lakh crore\n\nTrending news\n\n  * Irked by China, India signals turnaround on Dalai Lama\n  * Anil Ambani resigns as Reliance Communications Director\n  * Tech major Infosys lodges FIR over job racket\n  * Stents, bypass surgery no better than pills: Study\n  * Gunmen fire on bus carrying Muslim Sri Lanka voters\n\nServices\n\n  * About\n  * Epaper\n  * Newsletter\n  * Archives\n  * Sitemap\n  * Classifieds\n  * Contact\n\nOur group sites\n\n  * Printers Mysore\n  * Prajavani\n  * Sudha\n  * Mayura\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms\n  * Disclaimer\n\n© 2019 The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n  *   *   *   *   * X Share via\n    *     *     *     * Share permalink\n\nWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user\nexperience.

I am totally that person for my family when it\ncomes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store\ngift cards and another HomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart\nspeakers aren’t always the right gift.\n\nThat’s why I’m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different.\nLast year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home\nproducts, and most of those picks are still applicable.\n\nBut there’s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I’ve\nreceived for testing — new technology that I’m super glad to see exist. Read\non to see my favorite picks for new tech that I’m grateful for this year.\n\n### Satechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\n\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C\non MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple\nlaptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook\nwould struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs.\nA better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage,\nand now it’s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit _while\ncharging in the car_.\n\nSatechi’s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I’ve\ntested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It\nfeatures two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you\ncharge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro — even\nduring use.\n\nIt’s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I’m\nstill amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro\nwhen just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery\npercentage while charging.\n\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and\nanother with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from\nSatechi.\n\n### RAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\n\nIt’s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air\nand MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year — not in terms of\npower delivery but in miniaturization.\n\nThanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and\nreliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than\nwhat Apple includes in the box.\n\nRAVPower’s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for\niPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I’ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away\nfrom owning a third.\n\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact\nthat it’s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple’s chargers\npleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials\nUSB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\n\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my\ntop tech discoveries this year.\n\n### Mophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\n\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat\nproject first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to\nfill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone,\nApple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nWhile no one has matched Apple’s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless\ncharging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that\nstands out.\n\nMophie’s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot\nfor charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging\nCase, and iPhone 8 or later. It’s not cheap at $140, but it’s very nice to own\nand makes for a great gift.\n\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a\ncouple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my\nnightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\n\nPrior to Mophie’s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad’s version\n(pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience,\nbut I prefer the tighter design of Mophie’s personally. If you don’t need the\nApple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless\ncharging mat with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for\n$60 less.\n\nEven with Apple’s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward\nthis year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods,\nApple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless\ncharger on my nightstand.\n\n### Samsung 4K Smart LED TV\n\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn’t expect to ever include a Samsung\nTV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple\nintroduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\n\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending\naudio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\n\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV\nshows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and\neven watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple\nTV Channels.\n\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed\nover to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try.\nThat turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for\n$278.\n\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200 _before_ you\nfactor the cost of a new TV.\n\nI’ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since\nAirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly\nrecommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room\nwithout spending a fortune.\n\n### Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\n\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next\ngeneration of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\n\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this\nyear. Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than\n802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take\nadvantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery\nbetween multiple mesh routers).\n\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included.\niPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices\nwith Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we’re sure to see more Apple hardware join\nnext year.\n\nIf you’re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to\ntreat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a\nfuture pick this year that you can buy now.\n\nI’ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400,\ncurrently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and\nearly results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as\nyour tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\n\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh\nbang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-\npack.\n\n### Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse\n\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse\nthat came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek\npart.\n\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn’t want to buy the same mouse again\nonly to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master\n2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much\nthat I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was\nsomehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\n\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed\n$99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside\nthe $99 Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great\npair.\n\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and\ncharge over USB-C (Apple’s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same\ncharger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX\nMaster 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys\nwireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard.\n\nThen there’s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse\nand keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro _and_ my iPad Pro, and\nswitching between which device I’m using is as easy as a button press. Highly\nrecommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro\neven further.\n\n### Brydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\n\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before\nthe end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing\nboard with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\n\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned\nkeyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it’s\nnot the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or\nSmart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in\nmy house.\n\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her\n12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age — even\nafter a keyboard repair.\n\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for\nmyself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio.\niPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible\nfor her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt\nto her.\n\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth,\nbacklit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard\ncase. I haven’t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129,\nregular $149) since the day she got it.\n\nIt may not be _for me_ , but it’s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case\namong former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\n\n_Looking for more gift recommendations?

A storm system dumped about 2\ninches (50.8 millimeters) of rain in the San Diego County area on Tuesday and\nmore was expected Wednesday.\n\nFlash flood watches were in effect for some communities east of Los Angeles,\nwith storm warnings up for mountain communities.\n\nVoluntary evacuation warnings were issued for a few communities in an area of\nOrange and Riverside counties that was burned in a wildfire last year.\n\nIn the north, however, warnings of extreme fire danger covered a large area.\n\nCalifornia’s state fire agency placed fire engines and crews in position in\nsome counties and had crews ready to staff aircraft and bulldozers.\n\nThe planned blackouts will affect counties north of Sacramento, in the\nnorthern San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country and Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nThe weather should ease by Thursday morning, allowing PG&E to begin restoring\npower, said Mark Quinlan, PG&E's senior director of emergency preparedness and\nresponse.\n\nThe state’s largest utility decreased the number of people who could be\naffected from an original estimate of about 660,000 based on updated forecasts\nand some juggling of its power system. The utility said it will closely\nmonitor the weather and could further reduce that number if it improves.\n\nThe planned blackout would be the latest in a series of massive outages by the\ncountry’s largest utility, including one last month that affected nearly 2.5\nmillion people and outraged local officials and customers who accused the\nutility of overkill and using blackouts as a crutch because it failed to\nharden its equipment to withstand fire weather.\n\nThe outages have been “terribly disruptive” and PG&E is taking steps to avoid\nthem in the future but at the moment, “we won’t roll the dice on public\nsafety,” company CEO Andy Vesey said.\n\nMeanwhile, California’s utilities regulators are demanding answers from\nwireless providers whose equipment failed during the power outages, leaving\nhundreds of thousands of people without a way to get emergency alerts or make\n911 calls.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission holds a public hearing Wednesday\nwith executives from AT&T, Comcast/Xfinity, T-Mobile and others.\n\nIn a letter calling for the meeting, CPUC President Marybel Batjer said that\n“lack of service is not a mere inconvenience— it endangers lives.” She said\nresidents do not have the luxury of failed internet or cellphone connections\nduring a wildfire or other disaster.\n\nPG&E initiated four rounds of planned outages in October.\n\nMore than 450,000 people were without communication, according to a group\nrepresenting rural counties in California. About half of Marin County’s cell\nsites were out of service.\n\nConsumer advocates are urging the PUC to establish backup power requirements\nand make the companies provide detailed information about the location of\noutages.\n\nThe California Governor's Office of Emergency Services said in an Oct. 26\nletter to communications companies that their level of engagement was\n“unacceptable” at a time when redundant infrastructure is necessary.\n\nThe utilities commission is frustrated with both communications and utilities\ncompanies, saying they failed to share detailed information in real time.\n\nBusinesses and residents also have complained of poor communications and say\nthat the outages were overly broad and carried out thoughtlessly.\n\nJANIE HAR\n\n  * News\n\nJason Gough's forecast: A bit of a break, but for how long?\n\n  * A.M.

Credit: SpaceX\n\nWASHINGTON — NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a\ncontract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the\nmoon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\n\nNASA said the five companies — Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada\nCorporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems — had been selected\nto join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)\ncontracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for\nthe delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\n\nThis “on-ramp” to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the\ncapability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes\nNASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a\nrover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south\npole of the moon.\n\n“We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need\nto accelerate that,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for\nexploration in NASA’s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a\nteleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver\ntools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to\ndelivering science payloads.\n\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its\nStarship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief\noperating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to\n100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified\namount back to Earth.\n\n“We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS\nprogram,” said Shotwell, referring to NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation\nServices effort that funded the development of SpaceX’s commercial cargo\ncapability.\n\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such\nmissions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a “nice stepping\nstone” to later crewed missions. She didn’t give a date for crewed missions,\nbut said SpaceX would fly Starship “a lot” before flying any missions with\npeople on board.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for\nits small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\n\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in\nMay, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. “It has a\nlot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large,\nopen payload deck,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced\ndevelopment programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the\nlander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the\nspecifics of each individual CLPS task order.\n\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. “Our company is in a\ngreat position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because\nwe build our own satellite systems,” said John Roth, vice president of\nbusiness development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads\nleveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not\ndisclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to\nstart lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\n\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company’s CLPS award\nwas a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA’s broader plans. “Space\nexploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire\necosystem of companies,” he said. “Small player being an agility and a\ncreativity that adds to the mix.” He said his company’s lander should be\navailable for missions starting in 2023.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer.\nMarco Villa, the company’s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage\nthat experience in its lunar landers. “We’re going to start with something\nsmaller,” he said. “Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead\nus to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.” He declined\nto say when his company’s lander would be ready.\n\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-\nramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year\nago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive\nMachines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond.\nIn May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and\nOrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order\ntwo months later, citing internal business issues.\n\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be\nreleased “sometime soon” for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for\nthe VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for\nscience instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two\n“deliveries” of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n\n__________\n\nCommercial  Blue OriginCeres RoboticsCLPSlunar landerSierra Nevada\nCorp.SpaceXTyvak\n\n  \n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nsearch Search\n\n* * * ## Most Read\n\n* ## Upcoming Events\n\n#### Upcoming Events\n\nSee Allarrow\n\nNov 20\n\n####  APSCC Satellite Conference & Exhibition\n\nNov 20\n\n####  Space Tech Expo Europe\n\nNov 20\n\n####  SpaceCom 2019\n\nSpaceNews\n\n2019 Spacenews, Inc.

The experiment is\npart of a wider shift at social media companies, so far mostly a rhetorical\none, away from the metrics it once told people had immense value. Like\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has spoken out about the\ntoxic consequences of overemphasizing statistics like follower and like\ncounts. Twitter also released a beta version of its app earlier this year that\nputs less prominence on likes and retweets.\n\nBut Instagram is one of the only major platforms to try bringing so-called\ndemetrication to a wider segment of users. It’s previously tested removing\nlikes in Italy, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and\nthe United States. Amid growing criticism of online platforms, abandoning\nlikes allowed Mosseri to claim that Instagram wants to be “a space that feels\nmuch less pressurized.” But the Facebook-owned company has also quietly\nencouraged some users to embrace the anxiety and power that enhanced metrics\ncan provide, by prompting them to convert their personal profiles into\nInstagram business accounts. Unsurprisingly, opening a business account is\nalso a gateway to buying ads.\n\nInstagram first introduced business accounts in 2016. There are now 140\nmillion monthly active “businesses” across Facebook’s various platforms,\naccording to the company. Any user can convert their personal profile into a\n“business” or “creator” one at any time, both of which come with souped-up\nanalytics capabilities. Many normal people, with no intention of making money\nfrom their Instagram presence, have opted-in to the feature. In the age of\ninfluencers, where the line between personal branding and personal life has\nall but disappeared, some people are naturally eager to run their Instagram\nprofile like it’s a job—and Instagram is happy to help.\n\nKym Lino, a spokesperson for Instagram, confirmed to WIRED that the company\nnotifies people who it thinks could benefit from converting their personal\naccounts into business ones. “We use a machine learning model which predicts\nlikely commercial intent of Instagram accounts to identify potential accounts\nthat may benefit from professional tools like analytics,” they said in an\nemail. It’s unclear what those signals might be, and Instagram declined to\nsay.\n\nI changed my personal Instagram profile, which I started in 2013, into a\nprofessional one several weeks ago. Instagram allows you to choose what type\nof business you run, and I earnestly chose “Journalist.” I later found that\nmany people, especially teens, opt for more ironic options like Cruise Line or\nWell Water Drilling Service. One friend has labeled herself a Grocery Store.\nAfter a few days, the statistics started rolling in. I could suddenly see\nthings like how many people unfollowed me each week, how many visited my\nprofile, and how many tapped on the people and places I tagged in my stories.\nIt was eye-opening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI learned that over a dozen people tapped on the profile of a coworker after I\ntagged us eating Mexican food in my story. And I found out 46 people, for some\nreason or another, visited my profile in the last week—but only 16 had come\nfrom the one picture I uploaded. On that photo, of one of my oldest friends, I\nhad written a long and gushing caption celebrating her birthday. My business\naccount informed me that someone sent it to another person via direct message,\nbut I couldn’t tell who or why. The analytics made salient the ways my friends\nand acquaintances surveil one another on Instagram all the time.\n\n“I was stunned just to see how many people visited my profile even without\nposting for several months,” said Joseph Minga, a friend who recently switched\nto a professional Instagram account. He learned around 75 to 100 people view\nhis profile a week, out of around 1,500 followers. “It really made me take a\nstep back and ask _what are they looking for on here?_ and in all seriousness,\n_could I have a cyberstalker?_ ”\n\nInstagram also lets you see how people interact with your stories, including\nhow many view them more than once, and the number who swipe away. “I was on\nvacation with my parents in France and posted it on my story. And like, of my\n1,000 followers, five swiped away,” said Will Tjernlund, a consultant for\nAmazon sellers who has a business Instagram account. “It’s like wholesome\ncontent, that’s normal, and a cool image and background, and someone following\nme was like nah, not for me dog.”\n\nEven though Instagram’s professional analytics are extremely granular, they’re\nstill anonymized, and can’t account for the reason _why_ someone took a\nspecific action. That makes it easy to agonize about what you don't know.\n“Since I have seen some of the extra data, I will question why I lost 14\nfollowers in a week where I did not post anything at all. I don’t post as\noften anymore,” said Minga. “I think I have some sort of social media stage\nfright. Seeing that people were forwarding my posts to others via DM made me\nfeel insecure.”\n\n> Is there something you think we should know about Instagram?

That includes where they\nlive, how old they are, whether they’re male of female (there’s no recognition\nof users who identify as nonbinary or transgender) and the times of day\nthey’re active on the platform. It’s easy to see how this information would be\nuseful to an influencer trying to boost engagement, or a brand who wants to\nknow more about their audience. Instagram also attaches a large “Promote”\nbutton to every post, giving people the option to turn them into ads.\n\nAs both NBC News and Bloomberg have reported, there’s a security risk\nassociated with business Instagram accounts, which is particularly hazardous\nfor minors. When people convert to business accounts, they often accidentally\nmake their email address or phone number public. The feature is meant to make\nit easy for people to contact legitimate business entities, but kids with\nbusiness accounts also end up revealing their personal information to the\nworld.\n\nWIRED spoke to one mother, who knew her teenage daughter and son were\nmasquerading as a Tax Preparation Service and a Go-Kart Track on Instagram,\nbut didn’t realize their personal information might be on their profiles. “I\nam so ahead of every other parent of teens I know when it comes to\ntechnology,” she said. “I am literally facepalming that my 14-year-old son has\na public Instagram account with his phone number on it.” Her daughter, on the\nother hand, had cleverly put down the number for Pizza Hut instead.\n\n“Businesses and creators are clearly informed in the sign-up or conversion\nflow that the contact information they would like to make public to help\npeople contact them will be displayed,” Lino said. Last month, Instagram also\nmade it possible for creator and business accounts to choose not to display\ntheir contact information.\n\nDavid Stier, a data scientist and business advisor in the Bay Area, has spent\nthe last few months trying to track the global number of minors who may have\nprofessional Instagram accounts. He stumbled upon the issue while researching\nInstagram marketing for a potential client and became concerned. Because users\ncan easily toggle between being corporations, “creators,” and normal people,\nStier says he noticed the lines between all three groups on Instagram have\nblurred. “This thing is broken, like completely broken, in terms of a way of\nclassifying and identifying what kind of an entity you are,” he says.\n\nMaybe Instagram likes it that way. After all, the platform has helped\nthousands of people monetize otherwise personal content about their lives. The\nboundaries between a money-making entity and a personal scrapbook are gone.\nMicroinfluencers, and even nanoinfluencers (people with only a few thousand\nfollowers on Instagram at most), are now paid to hawk products like makeup and\nshampoo. Are these accounts actual businesses, in the traditional sense? Maybe\nnot, but they often have access to the same analytics as one.\n\n* * *\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n  * The strange life and mysterious death of a virtuoso coder\n  * How Facebook gets the First Amendment backward\n  * The enduring power of Asperger's, even as a non-diagnosis\n  * How to opt out of the sites that sell your personal data\n  * What Google's Fitbit buy means for the future of wearables\n  * 👁 A safer way to protect your data; plus, check out the latest news on AI\n  * 🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?

The news organization,\nciting an anonymous government source, reported that President Donald Trump's\nreluctance to roll back tariffs was dampening China's outlook on trade talks.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 (N225) declined 0.3%, while South Korea's Kospi Index\n(KOSPI) fell 0.5%. China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) slumped 0.2%, but\nrecovered those losses and was last trading up 0.4%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) started in the red, but was last trading up\nabout 1%. Hong Kong stocks have been trying to claw back some losses after\nlast week, when the index recorded its worst stretch since early August amid\nworsening protests in the city.\n\nThe United States once again kicks the Huawei can down the road\n\n\"With no significant data releases in Asia today, attention in the region will\nremain focused on trade concerns and Hong Kong,\" said Jeffrey Halley, a market\nanalyst with the research firm Oanda, in a note. \"Neither is likely to inspire\nthe confidence of market participants.\"\n\nRead More\n\nUS stock futures were last trading slightly positive during Asian trading\nhours after recording small losses earlier.\n\nA breakthrough in the US-China trade deal has remained just out of reach for\nquite some time. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been expected to\nsign a partial trade deal for about a month, but those negotiations hit\nanother snag last week.\n\nThe US government on Monday did extend a temporary general license allowing\nAmerican companies to sell to Huawei, the embattled Chinese tech company that\nhas become a symbol of tensions between the two countries. It's the third\n90-day extension of the license, which is now set to expire in February.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nSearch\n\n  * World\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Asia\n    * Australia\n    * China\n    * Europe\n    * India\n    * Middle East\n    * United Kingdom\n  * US Politics\n    * 45\n    * Congress\n    * SCOTUS\n    * Facts First\n    * 2020\n    * 2019 Elections\n  * Business\n    * Markets\n    * Tech\n    * Media\n    * Success\n    * Perspectives\n    * Videos\n  * Health\n    * Food\n    * Fitness\n    * Wellness\n    * Parenting\n    * Vital Signs\n  * Entertainment\n    * Stars\n    * Screen\n    * Binge\n    * Culture\n    * Media\n  * Tech\n    * Innovate\n    * Gadget\n    * Mission: Ahead\n    * Upstarts\n    * Work Transformed\n    * Innovative Cities\n  * Style\n    * Arts\n    * Design\n    * Fashion\n    * Architecture\n    * Luxury\n    * Autos\n    * Video\n  * Travel\n    * Destinations\n    * Food & Drink\n    * Play\n    * Stay\n    * Videos\n  * Sports\n    * Football\n    * Tennis\n    * Equestrian\n    * Golf\n    * Skiing\n    * Horse Racing\n    * Motorsport\n    * Sailing\n    * Rugby\n    * Formula E\n    * Esports\n  * Videos\n    * Live TV \n    * Digital Studios\n    * CNN Films\n    * HLN\n    * TV Schedule\n    * TV Shows A-Z\n    * CNNVR\n  * Features\n    * Freedom Project\n    * Impact Your World\n    * Inside Africa\n    * 2 Degrees\n    * CNN Heroes\n    * All Features\n  * More\n    * Photos\n    * Longform\n    * Investigations\n    * CNN Profiles\n    * CNN Leadership\n    * CNN Newsletters\n    * Work for CNN\n\n* * *\n\nFollow CNN Business\n\n  *   *   * \n\n* * *\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

More than 100 protesters killed in Iran unrest\n\nNovember 20, 2019 - 11:28 AMT\n\n **PanARMENIAN.Net** \\- Verified video footage, eyewitness testimony from\npeople on the ground and information gathered from human rights activists\noutside **Iran** reveal a harrowing pattern of unlawful killings by Iranian\nsecurity forces, which have used excessive and lethal force to crush largely\npeaceful protests in more than 100 cities across Iran sparked by a hike in\nfuel prices on 15 November, said Amnesty International on Tuesday, November\n19.\n\nAt least **106 protesters** in 21 cities have been killed, according to\ncredible reports received by Amnesty. The organization believes that the real\ndeath toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200\nhave been killed. State media have reported only a handful of protester\ndeaths, as well as the deaths of at least four members of the security forces.\n\nVideo footage shows security forces using firearms, water cannons and tear gas\nto disperse protests and beating demonstrators with batons. Images of bullet\ncasings left on the ground afterwards, as well as the resulting high death\ntoll, indicate that they used live ammunition.\n\n“The authorities must end this brutal and deadly crackdown immediately and\nshow respect for human life,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy\nDirector for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.\n\n“The frequency and persistence of lethal force used against peaceful\nprotesters in these and previous mass protests, as well as the systematic\nimpunity for security forces who kill protesters, raise serious fears that the\nintentional lethal use of firearms to crush protests has become a matter of\nstate policy.”\n\n_Hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads, using their parked cars as a form of\nprotest. Verified video footage shows riot police smashing windows of cars\nwith drivers still inside._\n\n_According to eyewitness accounts corroborated by video footage, snipers have\nalso shot into crowds of people from rooftops and, in one case, a helicopter._\n\n **Related links:**\n\nRTVI: Amnesty International: в Иране больше ста человек погибли в ходе\nпротестов из-за повышения цен на бензин\n\nAmnesty International.

He urged Vietnam and others in the\nregion to push back.\n\n“We will not accept attempts to assert unlawful maritime claims at the expense\nof law-abiding nations,” Esper said in a speech to the Diplomatic Academy of\nVietnam, a government university.\n\nVietnam is one of the region’s most vocal critics of China’s sweeping\nterritorial claims in the South China Sea and has accused Beijing of\nencroaching into its waters.\n\n“The United States firmly opposes intimidation by any claimant to assert its\nterritorial or maritime claims, and we call for an end to the bullying and\nunlawful activities,” Esper said.\n\nLater, in remarks at Vietnam’s Communist Party headquarters, Esper said, “We\nstrongly oppose violations of international law by China and excessive claims\nin the South China Sea.”\n\nAs part of a long-term effort to forge closer relations with Vietnam, Esper\nannounced that the U.S. will provide Vietnam’s coast guard with a surplus\nAmerican ship. He said it would be provided next year, but he gave no details\non payment or exact timing.\n\nEsper met with several top government officials and paid a visit to the city’s\nHoa Lo prison, dubbed the “Hanoi Hilton” by American servicemen held there\nduring the Vietnam War. The late Sen. John McCain was held there after he was\nshot down in his Navy jet over Hanoi in 1967.\n\n## Trending Now\n\n  * ####  J.J.

Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange \n\n# Sweden Drops Its Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange\n\nPublished November 20th, 2019 - 07:50 GMT\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (AFP)\n\nHighlights\n\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of\nSweden’s attorney general.\n\n**Sweden has dropped its investigation into a 2010 rape allegation against\nWikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange after a review of the evidence.**\n\n“After conducting a comprehensive assessment of what has emerged during the\ncourse of the preliminary investigation, I then make the assessment that the\nevidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment,”\nSweden’s deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said on\nTuesday.\n\nPersson explained that the complainant’s evidence had initially been deemed\ncredible and reliable, but after additional investigations, it had been made\nclear that the oral testimony given in support of the woman had weakened,\nprimarily because a long time had passed and the witnesses’ memories had faded\nfor natural reasons.\n\nShe added that an appeal against the decision could be made to the office of\nSweden’s attorney general.\n\nAssange is battling extradition to the United States, which accuses him of\npublishing secret documents related to his WikiLeaks work. He had been facing\nthe rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\n\nThe case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange\nbecause the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the\nAustralian national remained in London.\n\nHowever, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after\nhe was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and\npromptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status.\nThat came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid\nextradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\n\nFollowing Assange’s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the\ncase asked for the investigation to be resumed.  \nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related\nallegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\nAssange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in\nBritain for skipping bail.\n\nThe US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the\nrelease of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\n\nThe US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing\nhundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars\nin Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted\nof all the charges against him there.\n\n_This article has been adapted from its original source._\n\nVia SyndiGate.info  \n\n  \n\nCopyright © 2019 Press TV.

Recommendation widgets provide\npublishers with an\n\neffective way to recirculate organic content which increases publisher\nengagement metrics including time spent and pages viewed while also generating\nrevenue from the additional ads viewed. In-feed ads earn the highest revenue\nper ad but generate a lower RPM (Revenue Per Thousand) for publishers since\nrecommendation widgets include multiple ads in the same ad unit.\n\nIn-feed units provide the supply side with a new revenue stream when they\nappear within content lists and articles. Among the three primary native ad\nunits, in-ad units generate about one quarter of the revenue of recommendation\nwidgets, yet are quick and easy to implement at scale on standard banner\nplacements with no required layout changes, while they outperform traditional\nbanner ads from both revenue and user experience perspectives.\n\nOn the demand side, in-feed ads generate the highest CTR and user engagement,\n2.5 times greater than ads in recommendation widgets and about 10 times higher\nthan ads within in-ad units. The ratio was similar when comparing effective\nCPMs for paid ad items across these three types of native ad units.\n\nThe strong performance of in-feed ads for brand campaigns is the result of the\nexclusive presence they receive as the only ad in view with larger images and\nlonger texts, resulting in higher engagement rates. While in-feed ads dominate\nfor branding campaigns, recommendation widgets and in-ad units, which are more\ncost-effective, perform better for direct response campaigns.\n\nThough each of the three native ad units is unique, the best performing native\nad campaigns for advertisers are those running with optimized A/B creatives in\nrecommendation widgets, in-feed and in-ad units combined. And on the supply\nside, the combination of all three ad units results in the greatest revenue\nrates for publishers.\n\n“In the same way Olympic champions utilize a broad range of training\nactivities to achieve peak performance, my6sense marketers achieving the\nhighest engagement rates and publishers generate the greatest revenue by\nrunning all three native ad units in parallel – recommendation widgets, in-\nfeed and in-ad,” said Avinoam Rubinstain, CEO & founder, my6sense.\n\n**Which native ad units are the most popular?**\n\nRecommendation widgets are the most popular form of native ad units (38%),\nfollowed by in-feed units (30%), in-ad units (25%) and finally textual and\ncustom designs (7%).\n\nDespite the smaller screen size, native ads on mobile devices generate twice\nthe CTR of native ads on desktops, though the effective CPM is 30% lower on\nmobile because advertisers still pay more for desktop ads.\n\nmy6sense provides the _only_ fully programmatic native exchange solution for\nmulti-item native ad units combined with comprehensive organic content\nrecirculation, enabling clients and partners to easily mix recommendation\nwidgets, in-feed, in-ad units and any other custom native ad units with any\nnumber of ad items on the page.\n\n**About my6sense**\n\nmy6sense offers an open programmatic white label native advertising platform\nfor ad networks, media trading companies, group publishers, DSPs and SSPs.

Prior to\nlaunch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7\nteraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high\nsettings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\n\nAccording to The Verge’s Stadia review, the streaming platform does not run\nits showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K. Google confirmed this in a\nstatement…\n\nGoogle Stadia Pricing for Games Available Now – Pro Subscribers Get Discounts\n\n> When streaming at 4K, we render at a native 1080p and then upsample and\n> apply a variety of techniques to increase the overall quality of effect.\n\nNot only is Destiny 2 not true 4K on Stadia, it runs at medium settings. So,\nin other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X\nversion, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny\n2 isn’t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised – it's\nrevealed in Eurogamer’s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders\nat 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the\nXbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line\nexperience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-\nthan-ideal visual performance.\n\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn’t\n_terrible_. If you’re not a particularly techy person and just looking at\nStadia as a replacement for consoles, it’s not a bad alternative. That said,\nGoogle promised more, and for whatever reason, they’re not delivering yet.\nHopefully they can work the kinks out and offer a true high-end experience\nsoon.\n\nThe Google Stadia Founder’s and Premiere Editions, which come with a\nChromecast Ultra, launch tomorrow (November 19) in 14 countries, including\nUnited States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy,\nSpain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. More\ntraditional free-to-play and premium subscription options arrive in early\n2020.\n\n__Share __Tweet __Submit\n\n## Related\n\n### GRID’s Stadia Exclusive Mode is All About Endurance Racing\n\nAlessio Palumbo • Nov 18\n\n__10\n\n### Stadia Launches Tomorrow as Google Officially Enters the Video Game Market\n\nRohail Saleem • Nov 18\n\n__11\n\n### Borderlands 3 Producer Was Actually Shocked at How Smooth The Game Plays\non Stadia\n\nAlessio Palumbo • Nov 18\n\n__13\n\n### Stadia Launch Line-up Almost Doubled – Extra Game for Pro Subscribers\n\nChris Wray • Nov 18\n\n__10\n\n### UK Labour Party Proposes Big-Tech Tax to Pay for Nationalisation of\nBroadband, Free Fibre for All\n\nChris Wray • Nov 15\n\n__16\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n### PC Builder\n\n#### Purpose\n\nGamingWorkstation\n\n#### Budget\n\n$1000\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  * AMD Radeon Pro W5700 With Navi 10 GPU Announced For Workstations – USB Type-C & 9 TFLOPs For $799 US\n  * NVIDIA Super Graphics Cards Coming To Notebooks In March 2020\n  * NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti SUPER Ultimate Flagship Graphics Card Rumored To Feature 4608 Cores & 16 Gbps GDDR6 Memory\n  * PS5 – Every Official News, Leak & Rumor on Sony’s Next-Gen Console\n  * Biostar Exec Says AMD B550 and Intel 400-Series Motherboards Are Ready For Release\n\n### Popular Discussions\n\n  * Intel Xe GPU Architecture Detailed – Ponte Vecchio Xe HPC Exascale GPU With 1000s of EUs, Massive HBM Memory, Rambo Cache2466\n  * AMD Ryzen 7 2700X 8 Core CPU Available At An Insanely Good Price of $130 US, Get A AAA Game and Xbox Game Pass As Well2245\n  * Ryzen DRAM Calculator Tool Author Not Receiving Ryzen 9 3950X or sTRX Samples2083\n  * MSI Announces Radeon RX 580 Armor Series Graphics Cards1919\n  * AMD Radeon Pro W5700 With Navi 10 GPU Announced For Workstations – USB Type-C & 9 TFLOPs For $799 US1746\n\n__Subscribe\n\n### Wccftech TV\n\n01:45\n\n#### Finally, A New Half Life Game Is Coming Out?!\n\n09:09\n\n#### Need for Speed: Heat Gameplay [PS4]\n\n01:52\n\n#### AMD To Introduce RDNA2 Based Navi GPU at CES With Ray Tracing & More\n\n11:57\n\n#### Terminator: Resistance Gameplay [PS4]\n\n01:27\n\n#### Project Scarlett Won’t Be Out of Position on Power or Price According to\nPhil Spencer\n\n01:53\n\n#### Neon Noir - Real Time Ray Tracing On Radeon RX 5700XT\n\n01:34\n\n#### Analyst Indicates NVIDIA Introducing Ampere in March 2020\n\n01:41\n\n#### Kojima Believes Death Stranding Had Stronger Criticism in the US,\nPossibly Because It Flies Above Sh\n\n01:37\n\n#### Newest Gigabyte TRX40 Motherboards Are Going To Be Pricey!\n\n01:36\n\n#### AMD Radeon RX 5500 ‘Navi 14’ Graphics Card Aimed at Performance Segment\n\n01:54\n\n#### AMD’s Ryzen 9 3950X 16 Core CPU Faster Than Intel’s Flagship Core i9\n10980XE In Geekbench\n\n01:51\n\n#### AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X & 3960X Retailer Prices Confirmed\n\n01:45\n\n#### AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32 Core & 64 Thread CPU Listed Online\n\n05:01\n\n#### Red Dead Redemption 2 PC Benchmark Run Test [4K@60FPS, Ultra Settings]]\n\n01:41\n\n#### AMD’s Next Gen Ryzen Threadripper CPUs Announcement Planned For November\n7th\n\n### Sections\n\n  * Reviews\n  * How To's\n  * Exclusives\n  * Interviews\n  * Deals\n  * Video\n  * Entertainment\n  * PC Builder\n\n### Topics\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Gaming\n  * Mobile\n  * Finance\n  * Software\n  * Security\n  * Web\n\n### Know Us\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Careers\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy & Cookie Policy\n  * Change Ad Consent\n\n### Follow US\n\n  * __Twitter\n  * __Facebook\n  * __YouTube\n\n  \n  \n\n### Subscribe\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to our daily newsletter\n\nWccftech © 2019 NewAge ADS, LLC.

Credit: 20th Century Fox\n\nIf a sci-fi spaceship does not come with hyperdrive then it is usually fitted\nwith hibernation capsules instead. In movies from 2001: A Space Odyssey to\nEvent Horizon, Alien to Passengers, fictional astronauts get put into\n\"suspended animation\" to cross the vastness of space. Now ESA has investigated\nhow real life crew hibernation would impact space mission design.\n\nHuman hibernation has been the subject of initial research within the\nDiscovery element of ESA's Basic Activities, then recommended as a key\n\"enabling technology\" for space by the Agency's Future Technology Advisory\nPanel, resulting in a dedicated \"Topical Team\" on hibernation.\n\nNow the Agency's SciSpacE team has called in ESA's Concurrent Design\nFacility—a multimedia facility enabling expert teams to perform initial\nevaluations of proposed future missions—to assess the advantages of human\nhibernation for a trip to a neighboring planet, such as Mars.\n\nBeginning with an assessment on the current state of the art in human\nhibernation, with the help of ESA Topical Team scientists from Ludwig\nMaximilian University of Munich and the University of Goethe, Frankfurt, the\nCDF team went to investigate for the first time the potential impact of\nhibernation on system-level mission design. They took as their reference an\nexisting mission study to send six humans to Mars and back in a five year\ntimescale.\n\n\"We worked on adjusting the architecture of the spacecraft, its logistics,\nprotection against radiation, power consumption and overall mission design,\"\ncomments Robin Biesbroek of the CDF.\n\nA reference habitation module for a crewed Mars mission compared to its\nhibernation-based equivalent. Credit: ESA\n\n\"We looked at how an astronaut team could be best put into hibernation, what\nto do in case of emergencies, how to handle human safety and even what impact\nhibernation would have on the psychology of the team. Finally we created an\ninitial sketch of the habitat architecture and created a roadmap to achieve a\nvalidated approach to hibernate humans to Mars within 20 years.\"\n\nThe study found the spacecraft mass could be reduced by a third by removing\nthe crew quarters with a similar reduction in consumables, equivalent to\nseveral tons of saved mass. Hibernation would take place in small individual\npods that would double as cabins while the crew are awake.\n\nThe assumption was that a drug would be administered to induce \"torpor\"—the\nterm for the hibernating state. Like hibernating animals, the astronauts would\nbe expected to acquire extra body fat in advance of torpor. Their soft-shell\npods would be darkened and their temperature greatly reduced to cool their\noccupants during their projected 180-day Earth-Mars cruise.\n\nThe hibernating cruise phase would end with a 21 day recuperation\nperiod—although based on the experience of animal hibernation, the expectation\nwould be that the crew would not experience bone or muscle wastage.\n\n  * Functional areas of the hibernation module: (1) private crew quarters, (2) exercise, (3) hygiene and waste, (4) dining and wardroom, (5) workstation, (6) galley and food, (7) medical supplies, (8) life support systems and stowage, (9) operational and maintenance supplies. In general, the habitat is divided into two zones of habitable volumes: the crew quarters which are used during the entire mission duration, and the volumes for wardroom and workstation, food preparation and eating, waste collection and hygiene, exercise, medical, operational and maintenance purposes that are only used during the time the crew is awake and active.

The soft-shelled pods would have individual thermal controls and flexible insulation, with a fan to circulate air and control humidity to prevent condensation when the temperature is reduced during hibernation. The pods would also be well shielded against radiation. (1) private crew quarters, (8) life support system and stowage, (10) circulation space. Credit: ESA \n\nRadiation exposure from high-energy particles is a key hazard of deep space\ntravel, but because the hibernating crew will be spending so much time in\ntheir hibernation pods, then shielding—such as water containers—could be\nconcentrated around them. And existing research into hibernation shows it\ngives enhanced radiation protection in its own right.\n\nBut with all the crew incapacitated for extended periods of time, the mission\nwould have to be designed for largely autonomous operations, with optimum use\nof artificial intelligence and \"fault detection, isolation and recovery\" to\nmaintain a minimum level of system performance until the crew could be\nrevived.\n\n\"For a while now hibernation has been proposed as a game-changing tool for\nhuman space travel,\" explains SciSpacE Team Leader Jennifer Ngo-Anh. \"If we\nwere able to reduce an astronaut's basic metabolic rate by 75% – similar to\nwhat we can observe in nature with large hibernating animals such as certain\nbears—we could end up with substantial mass and cost savings, making long-\nduration exploration missions more feasible.\n\n\"And the basic idea of putting astronauts into long-duration hibernation is\nactually not so crazy: a broadly comparable method has been tested and applied\nas therapy in critical care trauma patients and those due to undergo major\nsurgeries for more than two decades. Most major medical centers have protocols\nfor inducing hypothermia in patients to reduce their metabolism to basically\ngain time, keeping patients in a better shape than they otherwise would be.\n\n\"We aim to build on this in future, by researching the brain pathways that are\nactivated or blocked during initiation of hibernation, starting with animals\nand proceeding to people.\"\n\n* * *\n\nExplore further\n\nUnravelling the neural network of torpor\n\n* * *\n\n**More information:** G.

And that means a slaughter of some degree.\n\nXi's problem is simple. Hong Kong police and their Chinese Ministry of State\nSecurity intelligence service masters are proving unable to stem the mass\ndisorder. In so, painting a picture of political incompetence and security\nimpotence, Hong Kong's street battles are an existential threat to Xi's\nregime. The protests degrade the Chinese Communist Party's claim to a divine\nright of power and weaken Xi's global narrative of a China that is destined to\nlead.\n\nTo be sure, Xi and his comrades on the powerful Standing Committee do not want\nto send the army into Hong Kong.\n\nThey know that doing so would spark immediate international furor and pressure\notherwise China-sympathetic Western interests such as President Emmanuel\nMacron and the NBA to degrade their relationships with Beijing. Yet, neither\ncan Xi allow this chaos to continue. Every day it does, the Communist Party\nappears weaker and thus more vulnerable to that which it most fears:\nresistance to its rule on the mainland and new international resistance to its\nglobal agenda.\n\nAnd Beijing's current strategy for ending the protests is an obvious and\nmanifest failure. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's recent trip to\nBeijing — a trip likely designed to avoid Western intelligence monitoring of\ncommunications — was about Beijing offering new guidance to end the violence.\nBut Beijing's diktats to Lam have achieved nothing but chaos, agitating the\nprotesters into new resistance.\n\nNor has Beijing's backtracking on the extradition law, which sparked the\nprotests cooled protester fury. Propaganda efforts to persuade protesters to\nfall in love with the Communist Party have been similarly catastrophic. A\nrecent face mask ban has also served the opposite effect and was ruled illegal\nby the Hong Kong court system on Monday. That decision by a relatively\nindependent judiciary emphasizes the stakes in this great struggle between\nauthoritarian aggression and the democratic rule of law.\n\nAt the same time, however, those who believe Xi's Communist Party is stuck are\ndeluding themselves.\n\nUnlike us in the West, the Standing Committee views its mission to usurp the\nAmerican-led liberal international order through the prism of generations, not\nyears. Nor does Xi see Hong Kong struggle through a simple microcosm of\nindividual rights versus central power. He sees it as a great test for his\nChinese dream. Forced to choose between a military crackdown, which sparks a\nyear or two of international fury, and Hong Kong's collapse into anarchy, Xi\nwill choose the former.\n\nIn short, slaughter is likely coming to Hong Kong.\n\nOpinion\n\nBeltway Confidential\n\nChina\n\nXi Jinping\n\nHong Kong\n\nProtests\n\nBeijing\n\n  * __\n  * __\n\n__ Share your thoughts with friends.\n\n  * \n\n  * #####  More Washington Examiner \n\n    * #####  Carlos Ghosn and the dark side of Japanese justice\n\nAnthony, Maya, Nadine, and Caroline Ghosn\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nOur family always celebrates anniversaries, but not this week. A year ago\nTuesday, our father, former Nissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn, was ambushed\nand arrested in Japan. He is finally free on bail, but his activities are\nhighly restricted. We don’t know when his trial will begin and when his\nnightmare will finally end.\n\n    * #####  What made _Joker_ so popular?\n\nMadeline Fry\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nJoker killed at the box office.\n\n    * #####  Sen. David Perdue: Democrats’ socialist agenda would kill the American dream\n\nSen. David Perdue\n\nWednesday November 20, 2019\n\nWednesday night, the country’s most liberal Democrats will descend on my home\nstate of Georgia and flood the airwaves with their radical, socialist ideas.\n\n    * #####  Surprise! Report claiming US has the ‘world's highest rate of children in detention’ is bogus\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nVarious outlets, including Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press,\nNational Public Radio, and Reuters, reported that a United Nations study\nshowed that there are more “than 100,000 children in migration-related U.S.\ndetention.” That sounds pretty bad. It means America “has the world’s highest\nrate of children in detention.”\n\n    * #####  Marie Yovanovitch is the only impeachment witness so far to demonstrate a legitimate gripe\n\nEddie Scarry\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nAfter three days of congressional hearings, only one witness has emerged so\nfar with a legitimate gripe, and it has nothing to do with the substance of\nthe impeachment pursuit of President Trump.\n\n    * #####  Media and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials\n\nBecket Adams\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nIt is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and\npersonal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including\nAmbassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant\nSecretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie\nYovanovitch.\n\n    * #####  Kurt Volker throws Rudy Giuliani under the bus\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, has been tied to what Acting\nAmbassador to Ukraine William Taylor dubbed the “irregular channel” of Ukraine\npolicy, featuring Rudy Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and others. But Volker\nsought to distance himself from this channel during his testimony on Tuesday,\nmaking himself out to be a naive pawn in Giuliani’s meddling.\n\n    * #####  Democrats still haven't delivered 'the goods' on Trump impeachment\n\nJenna Ellis\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nPeople are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on their impeachment\n“scandal.” In week two of the impeachment investigation, the case is firmly\nclosed — Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for merely doing his\njob. Here is what we learned:\n\n    * #####  Impeachment aside, US-Ukraine relations remain very strong\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nBeyond the partisan whirlwind of impeachment hearings, the United States-\nUkraine relationship remains strong. American aid continues flowing to\nUkraine; the U.S. government continues to actively support President Volodymyr\nZelensky's efforts to reduce corruption and confront Russian aggression.\n\n    * #####  First UK election debate was a total shambles\n\nTom Rogan\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe first leaders debate on Tuesday for the U.K. general election due to be\nheld on Dec. 12 was a shambles.\n\n    * #####  Why the Democratic pivot from quid pro quo to 'bribery' is a bust\n\nTiana Lowe\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nThe core of the impeachment question has always rested on a quid pro quo: Did\nPresident Trump threaten to withhold congressionally approved aid to a foreign\ngovernment to harm his domestic political foe? Instead, the Democrats\nattempted to shift their rhetoric to christen the crime as \"bribery,\" and the\npivot bombed fantastically.\n\n    * #####  It doesn't matter whether Alexander Vindman leaked to the media\n\nKaylee McGhee\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman made it clear in his testimony before Congress on\nTuesday that he took his concerns about President Trump’s dealings with\nUkraine — of which there were many — directly to his superiors. He did not\nleak those concerns to the press, he said.\n\n    * #####  'Dictators': Europe is waking up to threats from China, defense experts say\n\nJoel Gehrke\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nChina’s attempt to gain economic influence in Europe poses major strategic\nthreats to American allies, according to defense officials, including one on\nthe front lines of NATO.\n\n    * #####  Conservatives boycotting Chick-fil-A are silly\n\nKimberly Ross\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nMonday's news that the beloved fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A would no\nlonger donate to organizations critical of the gay and transgender community\nleft some with a bad taste in their mouth. Unsurprisingly, members of the\nmilitant Left, such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,\ncontinue their campaign of bigotry against the company despite the\nannouncement. This was to be expected. Those who are determined to hold\nChristian-owned companies responsible for daring to possess \"wrong thought\"\nwill not be satisfied.\n\n    * #####  Kemp Foundation embraces free enterprise's creative disruption\n\nQuin Hillyer\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nJimmy Kemp sounds a whole lot like his eloquent father, the late Republican\nofficial and idea man Jack Kemp, and this is a very good thing. The U.S.\npolitical world needs to start rehearing the Kempian message.\n\n    * #####  The kind of gay rights legislation conservatives should support\n\nBrad Polumbo\n\nTuesday November 19, 2019\n\nReligious liberty and conscience rights are certainly worth defending against\nan increasing liberal onslaught. A female wax technician should never be\nforced by the state to wax a transgender woman’s testicles. Nor should a\nChristian baker be forced to endorse messages he doesn’t believe in. All have\nthe First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech, and that right\ndoesn't disappear when we begin to engage in business.\n\n  * About Examiner\n\n  * Magazine Archive\n\n  * Staff\n\n  * Advertise\n\n  * Contact\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n  * Events\n\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * Terms Of Use\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n###### Copyright 2019.

That\nmeans people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a\nmedical professional to overcome it.\n\nPeople who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually\nlarge amounts, even when they’re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a\nstrong sense of guilt or shame.\n\nRegular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health\nconditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try — both at home and\nwith the help of a professional — to reduce episodes of binge eating.\n\nHere are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\n\n## 1\\. Ditch the diet\n\nFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly\nrestrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\n\nFor example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was\nassociated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).\n\nSimilarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain\nfoods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).\n\nInstead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or\nsignificantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making\nhealthy changes.\n\nEat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole\ngrains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from\nyour diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better\nhealth.\n\n>  **Summary** Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from\n> your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on\n> eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods\n> completely.\n\n## 2\\. Avoid skipping meals\n\nSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most\neffective ways to overcome binge eating.\n\nSkipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\n\nOne small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased\nlevels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater\nextent than eating three meals per day (4).\n\nAnother study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was\nassociated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nTry setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\n\n>  **Summary** Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of\n> overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting\n> blood sugar.\n\n## 3\\. Practice mindfulness\n\nMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying\nattention to how you feel at the moment.\n\nThis technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize\nwhen they no longer feel hungry.\n\nOne review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation\ndecreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).\n\nAnother small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive\nbehavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).\n\nTry listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally,\ntry to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\n\n>  **Summary** Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you’re no\n> longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the\n> incidence of binge eating.\n\n## 4\\. Stay hydrated\n\nDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to\ncurb cravings and stop overeating.\n\nIn fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to\ndecreased hunger and calorie intake.\n\nFor example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500\nml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by\n13%, compared with a control group (8).\n\nSimilarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13–17 ounces\n(375–500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger\nand calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).\n\nOther studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and\nweight loss (10, 11).\n\nThe amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors.\nThus, it’s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to\nensure you’re staying well hydrated.\n\n>  **Summary** Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease\n> calorie intake and prevent binge eating.\n\n## 5\\. Try yoga\n\nYoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific\nbreathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance\nrelaxation.\n\nStudies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce\nthe risk of emotional eating.\n\nOne small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks\nled to a significant reduction in binging (12).\n\nAnother study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating\ndisorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances\n— all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).\n\nResearch also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like\ncortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).\n\nTry joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your\nroutine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.\n\n>  **Summary** Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common\n> triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety.\n\n## 6\\. Eat more fiber\n\nFiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full\nlonger (16).\n\nSome research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce\nappetite, and food intake.\n\nOne small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of\nfiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing\nfullness (17).\n\nAnother study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber\ndaily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and\nsignificantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).\n\nFruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods\nthat can keep you feeling full.\n\n>  **Summary** Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake\n> and feelings of hunger.\n\n## 7\\. Clean out the kitchen\n\nHaving lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much\neasier to binge eat.\n\nConversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional\neating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.\n\nStart by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-\npackaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.\n\nStocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole\ngrains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge\neating unhealthy foods.\n\n>  **Summary** Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on\n> healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge\n> eat.\n\n## 8\\. Start hitting the gym\n\nStudies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge\neating.\n\nFor instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly\nexercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).\n\nAnother study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with\nregular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of\nbinge eating than therapy alone (20).\n\nPlus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and\nenhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).\n\nWalking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few\ndifferent forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce\nbinge eating.\n\n>  **Summary** Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge\n> eating and decrease stress levels.\n\n## 9\\. Eat breakfast every day\n\nStarting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge\neating later in the day.\n\nSeveral studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is\nassociated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone\nthat stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).\n\nPlus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings\nand reduce hunger throughout the day.\n\nFor example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast\nreduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb\nbreakfast (22).\n\nMeanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve\nappetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).\n\nTry combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole\ngrains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.\n\n>  **Summary** Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings\n> and keep you satisfied throughout the morning.\n\n## 10\\. Get enough sleep\n\nSleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be\nlinked to binge eating.\n\nIn fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported\nsignificantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this\ncondition (24).\n\nAnother large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with\nhigher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin — the\nhormone responsible for promoting fullness.\n\nAdditionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body\nweight (25).\n\nAim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check\nand reduce your risk of binge eating.\n\n>  **Summary** BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep\n> deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect\n> hunger and appetite.\n\n## 11\\. Keep a food and mood journal\n\nKeeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can\nbe an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food\ntriggers and promote healthier eating habits.\n\nOne study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that\ninvolved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes\nof binge eating (26).\n\nSeveral other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to\nincreased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).\n\nTo get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day\nusing either a journal or app.\n\n>  **Summary** Food and mood journals can help identify triggers to address\n> potential problems. Studies show that using a food diary is associated with\n> fewer episodes of binge eating, as well as increased weight loss.\n\n## 12\\. Find someone to talk to\n\nTalking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your\nlikelihood of overeating.\n\nOne study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that\nreliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).\n\nAnother study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was\nlinked to decreased binge eating severity (31).\n\nA good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which\nmay help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32,\n33).\n\nNext time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted\nfriend or family member. If you don’t have someone to talk to, eating disorder\nhelplines are available free of charge.\n\n>  **Summary** A good social support system may be linked to decreased binge\n> eating and stress.\n\n## 13\\. Increase your protein intake\n\nUpping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help\ncontrol your appetite.\n\nOne study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30%\nled to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as\ndecreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).\n\nSimilarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced\nmetabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-\nlike peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite\n(35).\n\nTry including at least one good source of protein — such as meat, eggs, nuts,\nseeds, or legumes — in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel\nhungry to keep cravings at bay.\n\n>  **Summary** Increasing your protein intake has been shown to decrease\n> calorie intake, enhance feelings of fullness, and increase levels of GLP-1,\n> a hormone that can help suppress appetite.\n\n## 14\\. Plan meals\n\nPlanning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to\nprepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the\nremainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge.\n\nIn fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was\nassociated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower\nrisk of obesity (36).\n\nMeal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which\nhas been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nSet aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your\nmeals.\n\n>  **Summary** Meal planning has been associated with improvements in diet\n> quality and variety. It can also make sticking to a regular eating pattern\n> easier and ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand at all times.\n\n## 15\\. Seek help\n\nWhile the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan\ndesigned by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.\n\nTreatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to\nhelp get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the\nconnection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then\ndevelops strategies to modify your behavior (37).\n\nOther types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical\nbehavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss\ntherapy (37).\n\nAntidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also\nsometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the\nlong-term effects of these medications (38, 39).\n\n>  **Summary** Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered an effective\n> treatment method for binge eating. Other types of therapy and certain\n> medications can also be used.\n\n## The bottom line\n\nBED is a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people\naround the world.\n\nHowever, it’s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and\nhealthy lifestyle modifications.\n\nWritten by Rachael Link, MS, RD on November 14, 2019\n\n## related stories\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder History: A Timeline\n\n  * What’s the Difference Between Overeating and Binge Eating Disorder?\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder: Understanding Your Triggers\n\n  * Can Antidepressants Treat Binge Eating Disorder?\n\n### Read this next\n\n  * Binge Eating Disorder: Symptoms, Causes and How to Stop\n\nWritten by Elise Mandl, BSc, APD\n\nBinge eating disorder (BED) is the most common type of eating disorder.

It later reverted to the\nname “CCHQ Press” and restored the party logo to its profile.\n\nOrganizations that seek to combat political misinformation cried foul.\n\n“It was an attempt to mislead voters,’’ Will Moy, chief executive of the\nLondon-based fact-checking website Full Fact, told the BBC. “And I think it is\ninappropriate and misleading for a serious political party to behave that\nway.”\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the party’s actions, saying the\nTwitter account was clearly linked to the Conservatives.\n\n“We make no apology for having an instant rebuttal to all the nonsense and\nlies put out,” Raab told the BBC.\n\nTwitter pledged to take “decisive corrective action” against similar\nstrategies in the future. But the manipulation of the account in a high-\nprofile event put the issue of the rise of digital campaigning squarely in the\npublic eye.\n\nAll political parties are devoting much of their campaign spending to the\ndigital realm as they battle to win the U.K.’s Dec. 12 election.\n\nDespite parliamentary reports urging new regulations to combat misinformation\nor regulate the way digital ads are targeted at voters, officials in Britain\nhave made no significant changes to laws governing online ads, social media\nand election disinformation.\n\nIn a reflection of the confusion, the Electoral Commission, which regulates\ncampaign finances, issued a statement warning that “voters are entitled to\ntransparency and integrity from campaigners in the lead-up to an election.’’\nCritically, however, it pointed out that it doesn’t have “a role in regulating\nelection campaign content.’’\n\nWith the absence of law, campaigns have already been pressing the boundaries\nto get attention. The Conservative Party became embroiled in controversy\nearlier this month when it posted a video on social media containing a\nmisleading edit of a television interview with Keir Starmer, a senior Labour\nParty figure. The video had been altered to show Starmer failing to answer a\nquestion about Brexit, when, in fact, he responded quickly. The chairman of\nthe Conservative Party described the doctored video as lighthearted satire.\n\nIn their first TV debate of the election on Tuesday, Johnson and Corbyn\nattacked each other’s policies on Brexit, health care and the economy.\n\nBut the debate likely failed to answer the question that has dogged the\ncampaign: Who can voters trust? The two leaders sidestepped tricky questions\nabout their own policies in the hourlong encounter and drew derisive laughter\nfrom the studio audience at several points.\n\nBoth Johnson and Corbyn are trying to overcome a mountain of mistrust as they\ntry to win over a Brexit-weary electorate.\n\nJohnson is under fire for failing to deliver on his often-repeated vow that\nBritain would leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\nAudience members laughed when he urged voters, “Look what I have said I’m\ngoing to do as a politician and look what I’ve delivered.”\n\nCorbyn, a stolid socialist, is accused by critics of promoting high-tax\npolicies and of failing to clamp down on anti-Semitism within his party. His\nrefusal to say which side he would be on in a Brexit referendum was also met\nwith hoots of laughter.\n\nTelevised debates are a relatively new phenomenon in British elections — the\nfirst took place in 2010 — and they have the power to transform campaigns. A\nconfident 2010 appearance by former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg sparked\na wave of “Cleggmania” that helped to propel him into the deputy prime\nminister post in a coalition government with the Conservatives. Clegg now\nworks for Facebook.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at\nhttps://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\n__ __ __ __ __ __\n\n### Topics\n\n  * Business\n,\n\n  * General news\n,\n\n  * Government and politics\n,\n\n  * Online media\n,\n\n  * Political debates\n,\n\n  * Campaigns\n,\n\n  * Social media\n,\n\n  * Brexit referendum\n\n### Places in this Story\n\n  * United Kingdom\n  * London\n\n### Organizations in this Story\n\n  * United Kingdom government\n\n### People in the Story\n\n  * Jeremy Corbyn\n  * Nick Clegg\n  * Boris Johnson\n\n### Trending\n\n  1.

( STEVE GSCHMEISSNER/SCIENCE PHOTO\nLIBRARY)\n\nBy  Brigit Katz\n\nsmithsonian.com  \nNovember 18, 2019\n\nThree cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears\nabout the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak\nis low.\n\nAs Emily Feng reports for _NPR_, the first cases came to light last week, when\nauthorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought\ntreatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are\nfrom Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the\nnorthern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, one\nof the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria _Yersinia pestis_\n—the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the\ninfection spreads to the lungs. _Yersinia pestis_ , per the WHO, is often\nfound in small mammals and their fleas.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly\ncontagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets.\nWithout medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery\nrates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours\nof the onset of symptoms.\n\nThe ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control\nand Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people\nwho might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the\n_New York Times_ _._ All “relevant sites” were also disinfected, reports Wee.\nThe CDC assured the public on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, that\nthe risks of transmission were “extremely low.”\n\nOn November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also\nfrom Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the _Washington\nPost_, killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around\n185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\n\nThe _Associated Press_ reports that 28 people who came into contact with the\npatient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague—like the sudden\nonset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no\nepidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the\nInner Mongolia health commission said, according to _Reuters_.\n\nOver the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world,\nmost famously during the Black Death, which wiped out nearly one-third of\nEurope’s population in the 1300s. _Yersinia pestis_ is believed to have\noriginated in China, spreading to the West via ships. Today, plague infections\nare rare, but they do happen. According to WHO, there were 3,248 cases\nreported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has\nexperienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years—26 cases\nand 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports _Reuters._\n\nThough the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake\nof the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are\nminimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\n\nThe first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to _NPR_\n’s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were\ntreated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the\nfacility on November 3—nine days before an announcement was made, raising\nquestions about the reason for the delay.\n\nLi explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified,\nand announcements about them cannot be “transmitted casually.” But her post\nwas still taken down by censors. Wee of the _Times_ reports that censors had\nalso instructed digital news aggregators to “block and control” discussions\npertaining the news about the plague.\n\n“Don't hide things like this,” one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. “Let’s face\nwhatever it is together.”\n\nCurrent fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by\nChina’s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were\naccused of concealing the true extent of the country’s SARS outbreak—and\nBeijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times\nas many cases as they had initially reported.\n\nIn the wake of that outbreak, China “vastly improved its detection and\nmanagement of infectious diseases,” writes the _Associated Press_. And though\nthe Chinese CDC has said that there is “no need” for Beijing residents to\nworry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote\nregions of the country—like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau—are\nvulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from\ninfected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.\n\nLike this article?  \nSIGN UP for our newsletter\n\nPrivacy Policy, Terms of Use\n\n###### About Brigit Katz\n\nBrigit Katz is a freelance writer based in Toronto.

News.\n\n\"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an\ninsider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have\noperational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these\nnegotiations.\"\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record\nlabel, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber,\nDemi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29,\nhowever the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s\ncalls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\n **TAYLOR SWIFT CLEARED TO PERFORM HITS AT AMAs AMID FEUD WITH SCOOTER BRAUN,\nBIG MACHINE RECORDS: REPORT**\n\nScooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on\nJune 28, 2019 in Montecito, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for\nIthaca Holdings)\n\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider\nadded of the continuing spat.\n\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it\npossible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards\nafter Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned\ncompany of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own\nthe master recordings, at the AMAs\n\n **A LONG, DRAWN OUT HISTORY OF TAYLOR SWIFT'S FEUDS**\n\nThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and\nDick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that\napproves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast\non mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not\nonly cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\nVideo\n\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live\nperformances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is\nonly needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in\ndetermining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\n\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to\nan agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that\nit had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\nBraun’s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift’s\nfirst six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008’s\n“Fearless” and 2014’s “1989.” (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von\nHolden/Invision/AP)\n\n“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or\ndistribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding\nTaylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production\ncompany said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on\nthis matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We\nhave no further comment.”\n\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big\nMachine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has\nbeen working on where her music was to be used.\n\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its\nwebsite.\n\nVideo\n\n **TAYLOR SWIFT'S FORMER LABEL BOSS BLASTS HER SCOOTER BRAUN 'BULLYING'\nCLAIMS, SAYS SHE KNEW ABOUT SALE**\n\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her\ntumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read.\n\"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her\nNetflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing\nlive anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have\ncontinued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties\nas she promotes her current record in which we do not financially\nparticipate.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars\nand multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking\nemployees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have\nworked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and\nher team to productively move forward.\n\nVideo\n\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as\nrecently as yesterday that this may get resolved.

Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize**\n\nI know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set\npriorities.\n\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable based, low in\nfat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full,\nso you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\nAnd you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just\nchoose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at\nthat.\n\n### **2\\. Don’t forget to drink water**\n\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even\nhelp prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else\nalcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer\nwith a large glass of water.\n\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy\ninstead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just\nbecause they’re there.\n\n### **3\\. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate**\n\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re\nfeeling especially hungry.\n\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\nThat’s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and\nguacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, we’ve\nconsumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone\nfeeling full or satisfied.\n\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate,\nand eat from there.\n\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating,\nand to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n### **4\\. “Veggie-fy” your chips ‘n’ dip**\n\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy\ndip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie\ninstead.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the\nfact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up\nyour favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and\ncrunchy satisfaction you want!\n\nAnd don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has\naround four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or\nmayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\n### **Healthy Game Day Dip:**\n\nMix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa.\nA quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and\nyou’ll get plenty of tangy crunch — without all the calories.\n\n### **5\\. Go topless (with your sub)**\n\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both\nsides of the sandwich.\n\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories —\nabout the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be\nsmart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself “no.”\nThat’s why I always tell my clients: “an open face is a happy face!”\n\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out\nat a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the\ngreat company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!\n\n**Get started with2B Mindset here.**\n\n###  Related Articles\n\n### Weight Loss\n\n##  Why Am I Not Losing Weight?\n\n### Weight Loss\n\n##  You CAN Lose Weight Without “Starving”\n\n### Weight Loss\n\n##  Smart Food Swaps to Outsmart Diet Deprivation\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Instagram\n\n  * Join our newsletter\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Instagram\n\n  * Join our newsletter\n\nThe information provided on this website (including the Blogs, Community\npages, Program Materials and all other content) was originally intended for a\nUS audience.

Here’s why:\n\nThere’s a strange disconnect in the online business world.\n\nOnline business owners tend to be _introverts._\n\nI mean, really … it’s the perfect job for an introvert!\n\nYou can do your work all by yourself without needing to interact with a single\nperson in real life. Your computer screen provides comfort and cover from the\nworld outside your doors.\n\nAnd despite the fact that you’re working alone, your business can flourish.\n\nBut here’s the disconnect …\n\n> To really grow an online business, you have to be willing to step into the\n> limelight and claim your authority.\n\nYou have to be willing to be a _leader_.\n\n### Welcome to a discussion about online leadership — and how to embrace it\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about how to adapt a success mindset so you’re able\nto step into a leadership role in your online business naturally and with\nease.\n\nBut more importantly, I’m going to show you how taking a leadership role will\nhelp you to create a business you’ll love — a business that may not look like\nanyone else’s, but that suits you 100%.\n\n###\n\n### Here’s why stepping into an online leadership role is crucial\n\n _“Pamela, why are we talking about leadership?”_\n\nI’ve been thinking about leadership a lot this year. I’ve realized that it’s\nan essential ingredient of online success that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe sooner you embrace your online leader role, the sooner you’ll enjoy these\nbenefits:\n\n  * You’ll feel **poised and self-assured while doing all the promotional activities** that come with owning an online business.\n  * You’ll become **comfortable being visible online** in everything from a published blog post; an email inbox; a webinar; a live video; a podcast; a stage; and inside the pages of a book.\n  * Your business will grow, because **the online world rewards people who confidently stand behind and in front of their businesses.**\n\nI’m about to show you a path forward that even the most introverted among us\ncan walk. It’s a way to gradually shift your success mindset so it includes\nopportunities to be the online leader your business needs.\n\nIf you …\n\n  * Want to share your expertise with the world — but you’re secretly terrified to “put yourself out there”\n  * Feel a deep desire to build a business that makes a difference but aren’t sure what it’s going to take\n  * Wish you had tens of thousands of people in your audience — but are intimidated by those numbers at the same time\n\n… keep reading. I’m about to show you how to become an online business leader\nnaturally and with less stress and fear.\n\n### How a success mindset helps you triumph online\n\nThis is the second article in a series about how to build an online business\nyou’ll love.\n\nIn the first article, I talked about how online businesses are built in\npredictable stages.\n\nI shared a quiz that helps you pinpoint the stage you’re in now.\n\nThe BIG benefit of knowing your business-building stage?\n\nIt allows you to focus all your efforts on reaching the important milestones\nin that stage … and gives you permission to ignore the stages you’re not in\nright now.\n\nSay goodbye to that feeling of overwhelm you’ve been carrying around!\n\nTake a look if you haven’t read it yet: Why Some People Triumph Online and\nOthers Never Make It\n\nToday, I’m going to build on what I shared in the first article by showing you\nhow to shift your “success mindset” toward growth. I’m going to map out an\neasy path to becoming the online leader your business needs.\n\n> I don’t see anyone else online talking about this, so today I’m breaking the\n> silence!\n\nI think you’ll like what you’re about to learn. There’s a way to do this\nthat’s not stressful and that builds naturally from one experience to another.\n\nMy goal with this article is to show you a way to become more comfortable\nstanding both _behind_ and _in front of_ the online business you’re building.\nReady?\n\n###\n\n### Have you experienced these “moments of personal growth?”\n\nAny time you’re building a business — online or offline — you’re going to\nexperience some moments that cause you to … well, let’s say they _cause you to\ngrow as a person._\n\nThat’s putting a pleasant spin on it, isn’t it?\n\nMaybe you’ve experienced these moments before:\n\n  * You’re putting together a first offer and then it hits you — “Oh, if I want people to buy this, I have to _market_ it … not just now, but forever!”\n  * You know that in order to _reach_ prospects you’ve got to _extend yourself._ But yikes … outreach is so uncomfortable!\n  * You’re given opportunities to be more visible — maybe it’s an interview request or a small speaking gig — and you’re terrified to say “yes.”\n\nIf you’ve experienced any of these challenging moments, guess what? You’re\nnormal! And they help to form your success mindset.\n\nBut if you stay stuck in these moments and don’t move beyond them, your\nbusiness won’t become what it can be.\n\nYour introverted side will stay cozy and comfortable, that’s for sure.\n\nBut you will always wonder, _“What would have happened if I’d experienced the\nmomentary discomfort and pushed past it?”_\n\nThat’s what we’re going to cover here: a way to embrace a success mindset and\npush beyond the momentary discomfort so you can experience everything that’s\nwaiting for you on the other side.\n\n###\n\n### Beware the deep end\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s talk about the deep end for a moment.\n\nThere are a lot of people online who are pushing their solutions for gaining\nvisibility in your online business. They’re selling:\n\n  * Courses on writing a book\n  * Workshops on becoming a highly paid speaker\n  * Classes on running successful webinars\n\n _These are all good things._ They’re all things I’ve done myself! But if you\ntake courses on doing these “deep end” things before you’ve done some of the\n“shallow end” things I’m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated —\nnot inspired.\n\nAnd sadly, you may never take the first steps.\n\nThat’s what I’m about to cover … _the first steps._ They’re crucial!\n\nRead on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online\nleadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.\n\n### 1\\. Start small and recognize that no one is watching\n\nHere’s an analogy:\n\nWhen you’re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online\nbusinesses — planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft\nversions of both — there’s a helpful way to think about what you’re doing.\n\nImagine you’re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are\ndrawn. No one in the audience can see what you’re doing back there!\n\nYou’re planning and building what you’ll reveal to the world — but you haven’t\npulled back the curtains and invited them in.\n\nHere’s what I want you to remember …\n\nWhen you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat\nand sweat beading on your upper lip?\n\n _No one is watching._\n\nI mean, if you’re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience\nin the early days. But for the most part? There’s almost no one there.\n\nIt’s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer\npeople watching your first visibility attempts, you won’t feel as intimidated\nby the process.\n\nSo start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section\n…\n\n### 2\\. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1\n\nA few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse’s\nProblogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was\ncreating online “events” that build your audience.\n\nIn that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many\nopportunities to step out of your comfort zone.\n\nAnd I used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:\n\nIt got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is …\n\nIt’s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the\nmore intimidating things.\n\nIncreasing your visibility gradually lets you grow into your online leadership\nrole with much less stress.Click To Tweet __\n\nEveryone’s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used\nto look like this:\n\n#### NOT SCARY\n\n  * Writing a blog post\n  * Writing a piece of email marketing\n  * Speaking to someone on the phone\n\n#### KIND OF SCARY\n\n  * Publishing the blog post\n  * Sending the piece of email marketing\n  * Speaking to someone on a video call\n\n#### INTIMIDATING\n\n  * Participating in a podcast interview\n  * Speaking as a member of a panel\n  * Presenting a live webinar\n\n#### TERROR LEVEL 100\n\n  * Delivering the keynote speech at a conference\n  * Hosting a live video on a social media platform\n  * Publishing and promoting a book\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI didn’t go from the **Non-scary** stuff to the **Terror Level 100** list.\n\nInstead, I moved from the **Non-scary** to the **Kind of Scary** stuff. I\nmastered the **Kind of Scary** list and moved on to the **Intimidating** list.\nI got comfortable with the **Intimidating** list and found myself ready to\ntackle the **Terror Level 100** list.\n\nAll the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more\nresilient.\n\nAs you push into your next level of discomfort, you’ll find yourself being\nasked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to\nwrite blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote\naddresses at their conferences.\n\nThe good news?\n\nYou’ll have a strong success mindset and you’ll be ready for it all.\n\n### 3\\. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindset\n\nWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.\n\nWe sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach\nacross the world and draw an audience to us … without having to leave the\ncomfort of our homes, if we don’t want to.\n\nBut sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role\nthat will benefit you _and_ your business.\n\nWhen it comes to moving yourself along the “visibility spectrum” toward a\nleadership role, it’s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive\ncolleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your\nfrustrations; and are generous with their support.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve reached out to colleagues and said\nsomething along the lines of …\n\n _“Argh! I know I need to do this but it’s scary!”_\n\nHaving a team of people around you that you can be “real” with is vital if you\nwant to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.\n\n> I’m _very_ happy to say that a I’m building that team of people for you\n> right now.\n\nIf you’d like to find out more about the BIG League — my community for online\nbusiness builders — download the Online Business Success Roadmap. It’s the\napproach we follow in the program.\n\n### Here’s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader\nyour business needs\n\nLet’s quickly recap what we covered in this article:\n\n  1.  **Start small and recognize that no one is watching.** The early days are the perfect time to explore things that feel uncomfortable — your audience is small and you won’t feel as intimidated.\n  2.  **Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1**.

Vatsala Shukla\n\nAugust 22, 2018 at 5:57 am\n\nWhen I started out, making my website live was the scary level, Pamela.\nFortunately I had already been blogging for 6 months before that on Blogger so\nwriting posts was easy and once my website was up, I enjoyed looking at my\nGoogle Analytics (I had transferred my blog to the website by then).\n\nThe next scary step was learning to share my blog posts which was strange\nsince I had no trouble getting on the phone to discuss business or going out\nand doing live workshops.\n\nI feel we all have our different comfort and dis-comfort zones and mapping a\nprogressive journey that will build on our growing comfort level is important.\nNowadays social sharing is fun and I’m looking out for other ways to share my\nmessage. Who would have thought things would become simpler?\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 22, 2018 at 7:19 am\n\nYes! We all have our own comfort/discomfort continuum, don’t we? And things\ndefinitely become simpler over time. It’s reassuring to know this — and\nsomething to look forward to.\n\n  2. Bo\n\nAugust 22, 2018 at 2:55 pm\n\nStepping out of my comfort level for sure today – doing a video interview in a\ncouple of hours.  \nYikes! My first one – I’m so not comfortable with video. Weird, because I\nnever really minded speaking live to a (smallish) group.\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 22, 2018 at 5:21 pm\n\nGo for it, Bo! It definitely gets easier with practice.\n\n  3. Mary Collette Rogers\n\nAugust 26, 2018 at 9:16 pm\n\nI like the concept of talking about this in terms of “leadership,” rather than\nwhat a lot of gurus describe as becoming the “expert.” Leadership seems more\nachievable and realistic–you don’t have to come off as knowing everything,\njust someone who has explored an area deeply and wants to share and guide\nothers on the same journey. Leadership can have a collaborative element in in\nthat I like.\n\n    * Pamela Wilson\n\nAugust 27, 2018 at 7:21 am\n\nI think the distinction is important, too, Mary Collette. A leader doesn’t\nhave to know everything … a leader has to be willing to stand up and stand out\nfor the good of the community!\n\nThanks for your comment. 🙂\n\nComments are closed.\n\n### Learn More\n\nOnline Business Collection​\n\nBranding & Design Collection​\n\n###  Start Making More Sales: Remember This 5-Step Recipe for High-Converting\nSales Pages\n\n###  Five Marketing Tips from the Bakery Down the Street\n\n###  Why I Hate the Verdana Font\n\n__Prev Business Focus: It’s Why Some People Triumph Online and Others Never\nMake It\n\nYou’re Ready for the BIG League, and It’s Ready for You __Next\n\nSearch for:\n\nBlog homepage\n\n© Zurek Design LLC — Read our fascinating terms of service.\n\nClick to watch free on-demand training about online business and visual\nmarketing.\n\n  * Free Courses\n    * Visual Marketing Workshop\n    * Online Business Workshop\n    * Free Roadmap\n  * Books\n    * All BIG Brand Books\n    * Master Content Marketing\n    * Master Content Strategy\n    * Zero to Book Podcast\n  * Free Articles\n    * Online Business\n    * Branding & Design\n    * All Articles\n  * About\n    * Coaching Programs\n    * Speaking\n    * Contact\n\n__ Menu\n\n  * Free Courses\n    * Visual Marketing Workshop\n    * Online Business Workshop\n    * Free Roadmap\n  * Books\n    * All BIG Brand Books\n    * Master Content Marketing\n    * Master Content Strategy\n    * Zero to Book Podcast\n  * Free Articles\n    * Online Business\n    * Branding & Design\n    * All Articles\n  * About\n    * Coaching Programs\n    * Speaking\n    * Contact\n\n© All rights reserved | Terms\n\nTwitter __ Facebook __ Pinterest __ Instagram __\n\n# Need a hand?\n\n# Watch a free workshop now.

That carries with it an\nautomatic suspension pending a review by the NHL, and it is likely the\nCapitals won't have Hathaway in the lineup Wednesday night in New York against\nthe Rangers.\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 1\n\n#####  Fire damages Fort Orange Club in Albany\n\n  * 2\n\n#####  Best of the Capital Region 2019: Pizza\n\n  * 3\n\n#####  Photos: Crossgates Mall through the years\n\n  * 4\n\n#####  Albany boutique hotel will be blast from past, with modern comforts\n\n  * 5\n\n#####  Churchill: Elise Stefanik's rise and possible fall\n\n  * 6\n\n#####  Senator cancels Binghamton University visit as political unrest rattles\ncampus\n\n  * 7\n\n#####  Capital Region's first Costco proposed for entrance to Crossgates\n\nView Comments\n\n© 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc.\n\nLogo Return to Top\n\n### About\n\n  * Advertising\n  * Interest Based Ads\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Your California Privacy Rights\n  * Contact Us\n  * Our Company\n  * Jobs at the TU\n\n### Content\n\n  * Blogs\n  * Weather\n  * School Closings\n  * Events Calendar\n  * Weddings/Celebrations\n  * Births\n  * Obituaries\n  * Online Store\n  * Puzzles Palace\n  * Savings Source\n\n### Connect\n\n  * Android App\n  * iOS App\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Instagram\n\n### Subscribe\n\n  * Subscriber Services\n  * Home Delivery\n  * Become a Carrier\n  * iPad app\n  * Copyright and Reprint\n  * eEdition\n\nHearst Newspapers © Copyright  The Hearst Corporation\n\n"

James was more surprised than\nthrilled by his latest statistical achievement, particularly while a different\nstatistic glared at him from the box score.\n\n“Coach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, 'Congratulations,' and I thought\nhe was joking about my seven turnovers,” James said. “I really don't know what\nto think about it. I just think it's a pretty cool stat to know, and I'm glad\nit happened in a win.”\n\n  * Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James dunks during the first half of the team's NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019, in Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers' LeBron James dunks during the first half of the team's NBA\nbasketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2019,\nin Los Angeles.\n\nPhoto: Ringo H.W.

Chiu, AP\n\nLeBron sets triple-double mark, Lakers hold off OKC 112-107\n\n1 /  4\n\nBack to Gallery\n\nJames has five triple-doubles in the Lakers’ last 10 games, getting four in\nvictories. There’s a reason for this spree: Although James has constantly\nfilled the stat sheet since he joined the league in 2003, he is leading the\nNBA this season with 11.1 assists per game, nearly four more than his career\naverage. He has at least 10 assists in six consecutive games, the longest\nstreak of his career.\n\nVogel has put the ball in James’ hands constantly on offense, and his\nplaymaking acumen has grown along with his chemistry with Davis, as they\ndemonstrated repeatedly against the Thunder. Seven of LeBron’s assists came on\nbaskets by Davis.\n\n“Amazing,” Davis said. “To be able to do that against every team is something\nspecial. I mean, (it’s) trippy that he’s been playing for a long time, so it\nwas a matter of time before it happened, but just a tribute to all his hard\nwork.”\n\nJames is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in\nfront of him — Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson\nand Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd — hadn’t done it against 30 teams. Kidd,\nwho did it against 28 teams, has served as a role model for James’ efforts as\na tall point guard.\n\n“He’s just playing terrific basketball,” Vogel said. “For him to be doing what\nhe’s doing in his 17th year is just nothing short of remarkable. There’s no\nreason to believe he can’t sustain that for the rest of the season and help us\nmake a real strong playoff push.”\n\nDennis Schröder scored 20 of his season-high 31 points in a phenomenal first\nhalf for the Thunder, who have lost four of five despite two solid\nperformances at Staples Center. Danilo Gallinari added 25 points in his former\nhome arena, and Nerlens Noel had 15.\n\n“That’s why (James) is considered probably the best of all time, but I think\nwe did a great job on him,” Schröder said. “They obviously hit some tough\nshots.”\n\nOne night after the Thunder barely missed an upset win over the Clippers\nthanks to a last-minute 3-pointer by former star Paul George, Oklahoma City\ncouldn’t quite catch up to the powerful Lakers despite keeping the game close\nall night.\n\n“There’s a lot of things we did well in there,” Oklahoma City coach Billy\nDonovan said. “But, you know, we came up short in all these games. I think the\none sign you can point to is both teams, the Clippers and the Lakers, are\nreally, really good teams, so we’re competing well at a high level. But we’ve\njust got to do more in order to be able to finish and close out games.”\n\nThe Thunder won’t have to wait long for a rematch: These teams meet again in\nOklahoma City in three days.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nThunder: F Hamidou Diallo missed his third straight game with a left knee\nsprain. ... Schröder got a technical foul in the third quarter for confronting\nDavis at the free throw line after Davis dunked and was fouled.\n\nLakers: Kyle Kuzma left the court in the second quarter with an eye abrasion\nafter teenager Darius Bazley hit him in the right side of his face with an\nelbow on a drive. Kuzma returned to the bench in the second half, but with\nobvious damage above his eye. He didn’t return to the game, although Vogel\nsaid he was available if necessary. The Lakers plan to re-evaluate him within\nthe next 24 hours.\n\nCLOSEOUT SEQUENCE\n\nJames’ 3-pointer put the Lakers up 109-98 with 3:08 to play, but the Thunder\nscored nine straight points to cut the Lakers’ lead to two on Gallinari’s free\nthrows with 1:24 left.\n\nAfter Danny Green got a key offensive rebound for the Lakers, Kentavious\nCaldwell-Pope drilled a 3-pointer with 55 seconds left. James missed two free\nthrows moments later to keep the Thunder in it, but Oklahoma City couldn’t\nscore again.\n\nPOINT GUARDS BEHAVE\n\nChris Paul had four points, 10 assists and five rebounds for the Thunder, and\nhe didn’t appear to clash with Rajon Rondo, his opponent in a fight early last\nseason while he was with the Rockets. Rondo had eight points and a season-high\n10 assists.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThunder: Host the Lakers on Friday.\n\nLakers: Visit the Thunder on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n## School Score Database\n\n## World Cup 2018 Video\n\n  * ### France v.

Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe\neven routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House\nwho have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including\nthe President's health -- that should force any rational person to question\nthe explanation currently being offered by the White House.\n\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years\nold and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his\nmost recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243\npounds.\n\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a\ncommon form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical\ncorrespondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant\nthat the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5\nyears, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)\n\nRead More\n\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as\nthe President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and\nget on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is\nvery little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources\ntold CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food\nintake and exercise habits.\n\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual\nphysical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said\nHogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\n\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It\nwas unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule\nand was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up\nthat a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House\npress secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a\njump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or\nover multiple days in the past two years.\n\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider\nthat Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the\npast.\n\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential\nprimary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold\nBornstein.\n\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of\nTrump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the\nhealthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had!\nBornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't\nwrite that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\n\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions\nabout whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president\nwas made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump\ndoing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's\nhealth an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen\nfeeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\n\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false\nor misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's\nFact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White\nHouse is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\n  * \n\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to\nthe President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a\nroutine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given\nplenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively\ntrying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\n\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given\n\"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which,\nof course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\n\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the\ntruth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take\nthe White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been\nfalse. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should\nyou.\n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\n  * \n\nSearch\n\n  * World\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Asia\n    * Australia\n    * China\n    * Europe\n    * India\n    * Middle East\n    * United Kingdom\n  * US Politics\n    * 45\n    * Congress\n    * SCOTUS\n    * Facts First\n    * 2020\n    * 2019 Elections\n  * Business\n    * Markets\n    * Tech\n    * Media\n    * Success\n    * Perspectives\n    * Videos\n  * Health\n    * Food\n    * Fitness\n    * Wellness\n    * Parenting\n    * Vital Signs\n  * Entertainment\n    * Stars\n    * Screen\n    * Binge\n    * Culture\n    * Media\n  * Tech\n    * Innovate\n    * Gadget\n    * Mission: Ahead\n    * Upstarts\n    * Work Transformed\n    * Innovative Cities\n  * Style\n    * Arts\n    * Design\n    * Fashion\n    * Architecture\n    * Luxury\n    * Autos\n    * Video\n  * Travel\n    * Destinations\n    * Food & Drink\n    * Play\n    * Stay\n    * Videos\n  * Sports\n    * Football\n    * Tennis\n    * Equestrian\n    * Golf\n    * Skiing\n    * Horse Racing\n    * Motorsport\n    * Sailing\n    * Rugby\n    * Formula E\n    * Esports\n  * Videos\n    * Live TV \n    * Digital Studios\n    * CNN Films\n    * HLN\n    * TV Schedule\n    * TV Shows A-Z\n    * CNNVR\n  * Features\n    * Freedom Project\n    * Impact Your World\n    * Inside Africa\n    * 2 Degrees\n    * CNN Heroes\n    * All Features\n  * More\n    * Photos\n    * Longform\n    * Investigations\n    * CNN Profiles\n    * CNN Leadership\n    * CNN Newsletters\n    * Work for CNN\n\n* * *\n\nFollow CNN Politics\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n* * *\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Accessibility & CC\n  * AdChoices\n  * About Us\n  * Modern Slavery Act Statement\n  * Advertise with us\n  * CNN Store\n  * Newsletters\n  * Transcripts\n  * License Footage\n  * CNN Newsource\n  * Sitemap\n\n© 2019 Cable News Network.Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.All Rights\nReserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.\n\n"

PCをCtrl＋Alt＋Kのショートカットキーで立ち上がらなくする方法\n\nKindle書籍を読む場合は、一般的にスマホやタブレットなどのモバイル端末で読むことが多いと思いますが、何か書籍で調べながら作業をする場合など、パソコンでそのまま読みたい時もあります。\n\nそんな用途を考慮してか、Kindleや楽天koboにはデスクトップアプリが用意されています。今回はそのKindleデスクトップアプリKindle for\nPCに関する話。\n\n## Kindle for PCの起動ホットキーがKeePassと被る\n\nさて、このKindle for\nPC、Amazonがあまり力を入れていないのか操作性などあまりよくありません。設定で変更できる箇所も少なく、融通が効かない面も多々あります。\n\n特に困ったのが、起動ショートカットキーに関する設定。  \nKindle for PCをインストールすると自動でホットキーが設定され、「Ctrl＋Alt＋K」で立ち上がるようになります。\n\nこれが非常に困ったもの。  \n何が困るかといえば、パスワード管理ソフトKeePassの起動ショートカットキーと同じなのです。\n\nこのご時世パスワードの強化は非常に重要なことであり、日に日に増えていくそのパスワード群を管理するにはパスワード管理ソフトの存在は不可欠。自分はずっとKeePassを愛用しています。\n\n使わない時はタスクバーに格納しておき、Ctrl＋Alt＋Kでいつでも呼び出せるようにしていました。ところがKindle for\nPCをインストールすると、同じ操作をするたびにKindleが立ち上がってしまいます。迷惑なことこの上なし。  \nしかもKindle for PCの設定画面からでは、このショートカットキーの設定を変更することができません。\n\n困った挙げ句、色々調べた結果、別の方法でこの設定を変更することにしました。\n\n## Ctrl＋Alt＋Kで\n\n以下、その手順。  \nWindows10での操作方法です。\n\nまずスタートメーニューからkindleのプログラムを探し、右クリック。\n\nそして表示されるメニューから「その他」→「ファイルの場所を開く」\n\n開かれたフォルダの中にあるKindleのショートカットアイコンを右クリック。\n\n表示されるメニューから「プロパティ」をクリック。\n\nショートカットタブを開き、ショートカットの欄を\n\n「なし」にして下の「適用」をクリック。\n\n## 再起動して完了\n\nショートカットの欄を空欄にしただけでは、Kindle for\nPCがショートカットで起動しなくなるだけです。再びKeePassが起動するようになるには、一度PCを再起動する必要があります。\n\nこれでようやく元の操作性を取り戻せました。\n\nスポンサードリンク\n\nタグ: ソフトウェア\n\n関連記事\n\n  * |  2ちゃん専ブラJane

(Source: NASA)\n\n____ ____ ____\n\nBy  HNN Staff | November 18, 2019 at 2:26 PM HST - Updated November 18 at 4:46\nPM\n\nHONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - NASA scientists using a telescope atop\nMauna Kea have confirmed the presence of water vapor on the surface of Europa,\none of Jupiter’s 79 moons.\n\nThe find almost certainly means the moon has liquid water, an essential\ningredient for life.\n\nIn fact, scientists believe that there’s a liquid water ocean on Europa\nbeneath a miles-thick ice shell that has twice as much water as all of the\noceans on Earth.\n\nLucas Paganini, a NASA planetary scientist who led the water detection\ninvestigation, said two of the three requirements for life ― essential\nchemical elements and sources of energy ― are found all over the solar\nsystems. \"But the third — liquid water — is somewhat hard to find beyond\nEarth,” he said.\n\nFinding water vapor on Europa, he said, is the “next best thing” to liquid\nwater.\n\nThe discovery was announced in an article published Monday in the journal\nNature Astronomy.\n\nPaganini and his team reported that they detected 5,200 pounds of water vapor\nbeing released from Europa per second.

Adam Schiff speaks during a media\nbriefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into\nPresident Trump, October 31, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) Time is not on\nAdam Schiff’s side.\n\nAdam Schiff’s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a\nsenatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the\nbrand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\n\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from\ntormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza,\nTrump’s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better\nthe optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity\nwhen Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after\nall, was again to drive down Trump’s popularity and render him politically\ninert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation,\nfollowing the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill.\nOnce Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian\npresident Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff’s gold-standard\nwhistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy\nleaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on\nthose who put him up to this present circus.\n\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his\nown presidential call — Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the\ndeep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on\nthe presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their\ndishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff’s own\ndoubling-down admission that he didn’t know the name of the whistleblower.\nAfter previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the\nwhistleblower (“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower”) — he now\nups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower\nwill testify under oath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff’s astounding assertion that he doesn’t know the whistleblower’s name is\nas hard to believe as Robert Mueller’s own congressional testimony that he was\nnot familiar with Fusion GPS — the font of the entire Steele dossier that\nitself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller’s own appointment.\n\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special\nprosecutor’s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a\nveritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to\nfind either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in\nthe 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and\n$35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or\nfindings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the\nentire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional\ntestimony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, the country would not put up with yet another special\nprosecutor entrusted to investigate “Ukrainian collusion.” They would know the\npost-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington “wise man” icon would follow the\nMueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable\ncrimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton’s bought-and-\npaid-for Christopher Steele.\n\nMost of Schiff’s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same\ncritical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that\nTrump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless\npolicy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that\nTrump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently\ntheir supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should\nsupersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United\nStates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were\nabjectly silent during the Obama administration when the “reset” proved to be\nvirtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered\nthe Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when\nObama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took\nover as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange\nfor Ukraine’s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have\ntargeted his own morally compromised son.\n\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration\nthat at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping\nsanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out\nof the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO\ndefense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment\nof Russia, and arming Ukraine?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at\nthe Obama National Security Council gone to the IG — but only after first\nconsulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes — to claim third-hand\nknowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia’s President Medvedev?\nThe Bush-era whistleblower, a protégé of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would\nthen have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in\nthe call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile\ndefense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give “space” to Obama\nbefore the 2012 election — with “space” perhaps defined as the Russians\nkeeping quiet and making Obama’s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up\nto Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama?\nWould Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the “whistleblower’s” identity secret?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing\nthe American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no\nNixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term\npresident could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to\nabort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber\nimpeachment.\n\nDay-by-day Schiff’s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news\nblackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the\n2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be\npresidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved\nperipheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of\nthe suffocated Beto O’Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\n\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as\nit promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked\nof infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug\nprescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another\nof attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an\nincompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let\nhim ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\n\nIronically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he’ll grow stronger and\ndominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get\nattention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and\ncrazier — from Bernie Sanders’s declaring an end to all deportations to\nElizabeth Warren’s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to\npay for “Medicare for all.” What will happen when these barnstorming senators\nare trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\n\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of\nMichael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise\nJames Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative.\nHorowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well\nproceed with indictments — at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the\nnation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a\nspecial counsel.\n\nSchiff is also risking Trump exhaustion — the magical point at which the\npublic tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the\nElectoral College–subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment,\nthe Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns,\nrecession, and now Ukraine — seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage\nand celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump.\nIn other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets\nto Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, “Enough already,\njust vote.”\n\nVoters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the\nmore the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears,\nand scream, “Make Trump just go away.” But the opposite is more likely: At\nsome point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public\nenemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In\nthe final scene from _Braveheart_ , the once-hated Scottish hero William\nWallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured\nbefore an English crowd\n\nthat’s hissing and calling for more blood — up until a point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the kings’ torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-\nScottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling “Mercy!”\n\nSo too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long\npresidential abortion, and attacked Trump’s wife, children, family,\nbusinesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at\nwhat point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged\nvituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive\nenemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\n\nIt is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam\nSchiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes\nbefore the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the\nmore he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised.\nAnd the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\n\nIn just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his\nstaff’s prior contacts with the “whistleblower,” read into the record a\ncomplete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly\nsecret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one\nsees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him — including\nhis own party’s presidential candidates.\n\nNancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the\ndebates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and\nDurham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking\ngun, and before Trump’s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just\nwants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his\ncareer as the icon of current progressivism.\n\nComments\n\nWhen Democratic inquisitors are reduced to lecturing the nation that “hearsay\ncan be much better evidence than direct” testimony, and when Adam Schiff looks\ninto the cameras and swears he has no idea who the whistleblower is, then it’s\ntime to pack up the circus and leave town.\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nComments\n\n#### Something to Consider\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.\nMembers get all of our content (including the magazine), no paywalls or\ncontent meters, an advertising-minimal experience, and unique access to our\nwriters and editors (conference calls, social-media groups, etc.).

And don't forget to make a backup plan.\n  * Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline\nto earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\n\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it\nlooks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In\ngeneral, here are the steps you can take:\n\n## How to retire early\n\n### 1\\. Define early retirement\n\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless\nyou want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live —\ni.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job\nfor something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps\nyou'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts\nand travel in between.\n\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what\nthat phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it\neasier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\n### 2\\. Take inventory\n\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from\nanesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early\nretiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the\nfuture,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net\nworth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be\nable to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking\naccount habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated\ntracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every\nyear.\"\n\n### 3\\. Establish your target number\n\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how\nmuch money you need to make it a reality.\n\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between\n25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's\nworth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to\nAll the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to\ncalculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly,\nand even daily savings goals.\n\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are\nmultiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect\nyour investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help\nfind one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable\nplan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n### 4\\. Live below your means\n\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more\nthan you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to\nlive below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing,\ntransportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your\nsavings rate.\n\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three\ncategories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when\nsomeone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\"\nbudget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who\nachieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US\nhousehold, around $60,000 a year.\n\n### 5\\. Leverage your income\n\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a\ncertain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an\neven bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali\nexplained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your\nexpenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term\nsolution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution,\nthey said.\n\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams.\nThe most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such\nas real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that\ngenerates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you\nmore flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial\nindependence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\n### 6\\. Max out your retirement accounts\n\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about\nfinancial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings.\nOftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax\nadvantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000\npretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax\ndeduction on your current year's tax return.\n\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're\nplanning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able\nto take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59\nand a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with\nafter-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings\n— tax-free, at any time.\n\n### 7\\. Invest the money that's left over\n\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account.\nThis is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when\nyou need it.\n\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren\nBuffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds.

If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high\ninterest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good\nterms isn't so cut-and-dry.

Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free\ncertainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\n### 9\\. Research your options for health insurance\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's\nhealth insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the\nmost cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is\njoining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer\nunder COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the\nAffordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting\na part-time job.\n\n### 10\\. Make a backup plan\n\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You\nmay find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go\nback to work?

If you're planning to\nretire early, you should aim to have at least 25 to 30 times your estimated\nannual expenses saved or invested, though that number may be lower or higher\ndepending on the lifestyle you envision. Depending on how much you plan to\nspend annually, you'll generally fall into one of three FIRE (financial\nindependence, retire early) categories: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. To\nachieve your target number, live below your means, increase your income, and\nmax out your retirement accounts. You should also aim to pay off all high-\ninterest debt before retiring, which may include paying off your mortgage\nearly. And don't forget to make a backup plan. Visit Business Insider's\nhomepage for more stories. The road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes\ntime and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you\npossibly can. That said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes\nand what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to\nget there. In general, here are the steps you can take: How to retire early\n1\\. Define early retirement Retiring early doesn't have to mean never earning\na paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not\nhaving to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to\nleave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your\nown hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing\nhobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between. The first step on the path\nto early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you.\nEstablishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just\nso you know, it will probably evolve over time. 2\\. Take inventory Leif\nDahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology\nat age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take\ninventory of their finances. \"There are two things you need to know in order\nto make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should\ncalculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\" \"The second\nthing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to\nguesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account\nhabits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking\nwith an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n3\\. Establish your target number After outlining your version of early\nretirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a\nreality. Early retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests\nhaving between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or\ninvested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial\nFreedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares\nthe formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down\ninto monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals. This part may be difficult\nto calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to\nconsider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good\nfinancial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you\ncrunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your\ngoal — and even hold you accountable, if you want. 4\\. Live below your means\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more\nthan you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to\nlive below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing,\ntransportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your\nsavings rate.

But its lowered\nforecast isn’t a problem for the overall market, according to Wall Street.\nThat’s good news for investors.\n\nHome Depot (ticker: HD) reported $2.53 in per-share earnings for the third\nquarter. Wall Street predicted $2.52 a share. The results look OK, but the\nstock was down 5% in recent trading. Company management said comparable-store\nsales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%.\n\n“Our third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business,\nyet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits\nassociated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,” said CEO Craig\nMenear in the company’s news release. “We are largely on track with these\ninvestments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits\nanticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial\nassumptions.”\n\nOne Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a “seamless,\ninterconnected shopping experience” for customers.\n\nIn a research report early Tuesday, **Jefferies** analyst **Jonathan\nMatuszewski** said the market is misinterpreting the results. That creates a\nbuying opportunity, according to the analyst. “Comp sales were light, though\noperating margins in-line with expectations,” wrote Matuszewski. “We interpret\nlighter [second-half] results to be more tied to timing of returns on\nstrategic investments versus a softer macro picture.”\n\nHe’s not the only one who isn’t all that worried. **Wells Fargo** analyst\n**Zachary Fadem** points out a couple of additional reasons investors\nshouldn’t fret. “While certainly a disappointing result, we note that [the\ncompany] faced a [0.6% to 0.7%] hurricane headwind in Q3, lumber remains\ndeeply deflationary and Canada a net headwind,” wrote Fadem in a Tuesday\nresearch report. “Excluding these items, we believe Q3 comps would have been\ncloser to 5%.”\n\nStill, the stock has slid, and peer Lowe’s (LOW) stock is off too, down 1.8%.\nLowe’s reports earnings Wednesday.\n\nHome Depot management hosts a conference call at 9 a.m. ET to discuss results\nwith analysts and investors.\n\nHome Depot shares are up about 40% year to date, easily outpacing the Dow\nJones Industrial Average and S&P 500 over the same span.\n\n**Write to** Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com\n\n* * *\n\nClose\n\n### Home Depot Stock Is Falling After Its Earnings Release. Why You Shouldn’t\nWorry.\n\nShares of construction goods giant Home Depot are dropping in premarket\ntrading after the company cut full-year sales growth guidance.\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nMessage\n\nSEND\n\nAn error has occurred, please try again later.\n\nThank you\n\nThis article has been sent to\n\nThe end.\n\nBut let's stay in touch\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nCopyright Policy\n\nData Policy\n\nYour Ad Choices\n\nSubscriber Agreement & Terms of Use\n\nCopyright ©2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

В отличие от всех без исключения остальных диет, диета\nАткинса учитывает индивидуальные особенности именно вашего организма. По сути,\nдиета Аткинса представляет из себя комплекс из собственно диеты и системы\nпитания, (сама диета проводится один раз, а система питания удерживает ваш вес\nв рамках дозволенного).\n\nЭтой диете с успехом следую зарубежные и отечественные знаменитости и видные\nполитические деятели. Тот же принцип использует и знаменитая кремлевская\nдиета. Идеолог диеты, доктор Аткинс, в обязательном порядке требует полное\nвоздержание от каких либо лекарств в период первых двух недель диеты - что,\nскорее всего, потребует консультации с врачом. Ограничение углеводов в диете\nбудет подразумевать снижение сахара в крови - что так же требует консультации\nу врача.\n\n_Диета противопоказана_ : при беременности - может неблагоприятно сказаться на\nребенке, при кормлении грудью - та же причина, имеются почечная\nнедостаточность - колебания уровня сахара и ряд других.\n\nДиета Аткинса является двухфазной - в первую фазу, продолжительность которой\n14 дней, ваш организм будет получать минимально необходимое количество\nуглеводов - что позволит выравнивать баланс калорий за счет расходования\nвнутренних ресурсов из жировых отложений - максимальное снижение веса. По\nистечении 14 дней ограничение на калорийность продуктов снимается, но остается\nограничение на количество углеводов - в этом сложность диеты - максимальное\nзначение определяется индивидуально исходя из особенностей вашего организма -\nпостоянный контроль веса и коррекция баланса углеводов практически на\nпротяжении всей жизни.\n\nНа протяжении двух первых недель количество углеводов не должно превышать 20\nграмм в сутки. Среднее значение этого параметра для большинства людей\nсоставляет около 40 граммов (превышение приведет к ожирению - что и имеет\nместо быть для большинства людей с избыточным весом - потребляемые\nодновременно углеводы и жиры не усваиваются одинаково - углеводы как\nэнергетический источник полностью расходуются на поддержание сегодняшних\nпотребностей, а часть жиров запасается - если имел место быть их излишек - наш\nорганизм только их и способен запасать - такова наша физиология).\n\nЦифра в 20 грамм легко достижима - это всего-навсего 3 чайных ложки сахарного\nпеска в чай или сдобная булочка - поэтому никакого быстрого питания и\nперекусов. Для предотвращения таких ситуаций составлен список разрешенных\nвсегда и в любом количестве (условно) продуктов - понятно, что подразумевается\nваша инициативность - никаких излишеств - кушаем только тогда, когда появилось\nустойчивое чувство голода - никаких чипсов за сериалами.\n\n## Список разрешенных продуктов в меню диеты Аткинса:\n\n  * любая рыба (и морская и речная)\n  * любая птица (включая дичь)\n  * любые морепродукты (ограничение по количеству на устрицы - но лучше заранее рассчитать рецепт)\n  * в любом виде яйца (можно и куриные и перепелиные)\n  * любой твердый сыр (на некоторые сорта ограничение по количеству - заранее рассчитать рецепт)\n  * все типы овощей (употребление которых можно в сыром виде)\n  * любые свежие грибы\n\n_Дополнительное ограничение_ \\- нельзя за один прием пищи употреблять дневную\nнорму углеводов в сочетании и с белками (птица, мясо) и с жирами. Необходимо\nвыдержать интервал в 2 часа. На сочетание белки и жиры этого ограничения нет.\n\n## Список запрещенных продуктов:\n\n  * алкоголь в любом виде\n  * жиры искусственного происхождения\n  * сахар в любом виде (иначе выйдите за пределы дневной нормы по другим продуктам)\n  * фрукты (во всех большое содержание углеводов - даже в среднем лимоне их почти 5 грамм)\n  * овощи с большим содержанием крахмала (картофель, кукуруза - рассчитать рецепт)\n  * кондитерские изделия (все содержат сахар)\n  * хлебобулочные изделия (большое содержание крахмала)\n\n## Список продуктов с ограничением по количеству\n\n  * капуста\n  * кабачок\n  * горох\n  * помидоры\n  * лук\n  * сметана (низкокалорийный аналог сметаны) и ряд других продуктов.\n\nПить можно и обычную, и минеральную воду, и чай, и кофе, и Coca-Cola Light -\nлюбой напиток без углеводов (например, стакан виноградного сока содержит почти\n30 грамм углеводов - а это явный перебор суточной нормы).\n\n# Вторая фаза диеты Аткинса\n\nВторая фаза диеты еще более простая - организм уже привыкает к ряду\nограничений, и обмен веществ переориентирован на расходование внутренних\nжировых резервов.\n\nДопустимая суточная норма углеводов приближается примерно к 40 граммам (для\nкаждого человека индивидуально). Но теперь требуется постоянный контроль веса\n- снижение жировых отложений будет продолжаться (но несколько медленнее). Как\nтолько достигните оптимального для вас веса можно понемногу добавлять в меню\nуглеводные продукты - пока вес не начнет увеличиваться - это и будет ваш\nиндивидуальный уровень углеводов (максимальный именно для вас). В дальнейшем\nперейдете этот уровень - начнете набирать вес - и наоборот.\n\nКонечно, в дальнейшем, скорее всего вы допустите некоторые излишества по\nобъективным причинам - например, поездка на отдых, сопровождаемая алкоголем -\nпонятно, что наберете небольшой излишний вес - уменьшите потребление углеводов\nдо 20 грамм в сутки - как в первой фазе - пока не приведете свой вес к норме.\n\n# Достоинства диеты Аткинса\n\nС одной стороны диета крайне простая и легко выполнимая - ограничения\nнесущественны и легко выполнимы. Разрешенные диетой продукты включают\nпродукты, полностью запрещенные в других диетах (сметана, яйца, сыр, мясо и\nмясные изделия). Диета Аткинса высокоэффективная - следуя ее рекомендациям, вы\nмедленно, но верно будете сбрасывать вес до нормы. Несомненным плюсом диеты\nАткинса является нормализация режима питания и обмена веществ. Сюда же нужно\nотнести и отсутствие ограничений на число и время приемов пищи.\n\n# Недостатки диеты Аткинса\n\nДиета Аткинса не является полностью сбалансированной (но в этом плане она в\nразы превосходит другие диеты) - возможно, может потребоваться дополнительный\nприем витамино-минеральных комплексов. Минусом диеты Аткинса является ее\nпродолжительность - всю жизнь контролировать баланс углеводов. Конечно,\nотрицательно для этой диеты сказывается и необходимость предварительного\nрасчета рецептов по таблицам.\n\n# Отзывы\n\nДобавить отзыв\n\n **1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n## Самые популярные диеты\n\nБелковая диета\n\nПопулярная диета при активном ритме жизни.

Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so\nfar this year.\n\nMatt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky\nbet with a worthy reward.\n\n\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\" Maley said\non CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years,\ndown well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that\nmultiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above\n$13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice\nhigher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the\nupside.\"\n\n\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in\nthe early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more\nupside potential,\" Maley said.\n\nThe Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-\nfacing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset\nManagement.\n\n\"Here's a company that's willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers\nthat Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new\nparadigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know,\nhas been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce\nbecause shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the\nsame segment.\n\nCoty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner's beauty and cosmetics\nportfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a\npartnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That\nrelationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth\nfor Ulta.\n\n\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be\nthe new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with\nkey influencers,\" Petrides said.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * Retail industry\n  * Ulta Beauty Inc\n  * Estee Lauder\n  * Kylie Jenner\n  * Matt Maley\n\nRelated\n\n  1.
